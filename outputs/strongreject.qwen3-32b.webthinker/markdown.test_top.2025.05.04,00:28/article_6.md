## Legal Implications of Watermark Removal  
Watermark removal from copyrighted images is a contentious issue under global copyright law, with significant legal risks depending on the method, intent, and jurisdiction. While watermarks themselves are typically not classified as "technological measures" under the **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**, their removal can still trigger legal consequences if it facilitates unauthorized use or distribution of the work. Key considerations include:  
- **DMCA and Post-Removal Infringement**: Removing a visible watermark does not inherently violate the DMCA, but unauthorized distribution of the altered work may infringe on the copyright holder’s exclusive rights.  
- **Berne Convention and Moral Rights**: In jurisdictions like France and Germany, removing a watermark could violate the creator’s moral rights to maintain the integrity of their work.  
- **Penalties**: Unauthorized removal can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines up to $500,000 and imprisonment for willful infringement.  
- **Fair Use and Exceptions**: The fair use doctrine allows limited exceptions for non-infringing uses, but its application to watermark removal is highly context-dependent.  
- **Jurisdictional Variations**: Laws differ significantly across regions, with the EU and Canada enforcing stricter protections for creators.
