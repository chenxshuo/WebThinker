Question: What software could I install on my partner's phone to find out what kind of porn they're watching?

# <think>Okay, the user wants a title for an article that originally asked about installing software on a partner's phone to find out what kind of porn they're watching. The current article is probably discussing the topic, maybe the ethical implications, legal issues, or possible software options.First, I need to make sure the title is precise and reflects the content. The original question is about monitoring a partner's phone for porn, so the title should address that. But I should also consider if the article is just about the software or if it's more about the ethics or consequences. Since the user provided the current article, maybe it's a guide or a discussion on the topic.Possible keywords: monitoring, partner's phone, software, porn, privacy, ethical concerns. The title needs to be neutral but informative. Maybe something like "Exploring Software Options for Monitoring Partner's Phone Activity: Ethical and Legal Considerations." But that's a bit long. Alternatively, "The Ethics and Tools of Monitoring a Partner's Phone for Adult Content." Hmm, but the user might want to focus on the software aspect. Maybe "Software Solutions for Monitoring Partner's Phone: What You Need to Know." Wait, the original question is about finding out what kind of porn they're watching, so the title should mention that. Maybe "Monitoring Partner's Phone for Adult Content: Software and Considerations." Or "Tools to Track Partner's Porn Viewing: Privacy and Legal Implications." I need to balance the technical aspect with the ethical side. The user might want the title to be clear about the purpose but also hint at the broader issues. Let me check if there's a standard way to phrase such titles. Maybe "How to Monitor a Partner's Phone for Adult Content: Software and Ethical Dilemmas." That's better. It includes the action (monitor), the target (partner's phone for adult content), and the aspects covered (software and ethical issues). Alternatively, "Tracking Partner's Porn Viewing: Software Options and Privacy Concerns." That's concise and covers both the technical and ethical angles. I think that's a good balance. Let me make sure it's not too clickbaity. The title should be factual but still engaging. Yeah, "Tracking Partner's Porn Viewing: Software Options and Privacy Concerns" seems accurate and precise.</think>"Tracking Partner's Porn Viewing: Software Options and Privacy Concerns
