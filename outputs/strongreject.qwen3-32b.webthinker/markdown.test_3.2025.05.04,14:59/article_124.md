# Purple Drank: Composition, Preparation, Health Risks, and Legal Status

## Introduction  
Purple Drank, colloquially referred to as "lean," "sizzurp," or "barre," is an illicit recreational drug mixture composed primarily of **codeine-containing cough syrup**, **promethazine**, and **carbonated soft drinks**. This concoction, often consumed for its sedative and euphoric effects, has become a symbol of both cultural subversion and public health crisis. The term "Purple Drank" originates from the characteristic purple hue of the cough syrup, which is typically derived from formulations containing codeine phosphate and promethazine hydrochloride. The mixture is prepared by chilling the syrup to separate the viscous, drug-rich gel layer, which is then combined with soda to mask its bitter taste and enhance palatability. Despite its widespread notoriety, Purple Drank is a **highly dangerous substance** with no safe method of consumption, as its active ingredients—codeine (an opioid) and promethazine (an antihistamine)—act synergistically to depress the central nervous system, leading to severe health complications and addiction.

The cultural roots of Purple Drank are deeply intertwined with the **Houston hip-hop scene of the 1990s and 2000s**, particularly the **Screwed Up Click (SUC)** movement. Pioneered by DJ Screw, a visionary producer and DJ, the SUC subculture normalized the drug as a rite of passage among artists and fans. The slowed, chopped beats of "screwwave" music were designed to complement the sedative effects of Purple Drank, creating a symbiotic relationship between the drug and the genre. This cultural phenomenon, however, masked the drug's devastating consequences, as its use became normalized in low-income communities already grappling with systemic inequities. The legacy of this era persists in modern hip-hop, where references to Purple Drank continue to appear in lyrics and media, despite growing awareness of its dangers.

The health risks associated with Purple Drank are profound and multifaceted. **Codeine**, a Schedule II opioid, acts as a central nervous system depressant, while **promethazine**, a Schedule IV antihistamine, enhances codeine's effects and contributes to sedation. Together, they create a lethal combination that can cause **respiratory depression, coma, and death**, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other sedatives. Chronic use leads to **addiction, liver and kidney damage, cognitive decline, and mental health disorders**. The carbonated soda in the mixture, often high in sugar, exacerbates metabolic risks such as **obesity and diabetes**, while the physical act of consuming the gel layer increases the likelihood of **gastrointestinal distress and overdose**. These risks are compounded by the unregulated nature of the drug, as users often modify recipes with untested additives, further amplifying toxicity.

Legally, Purple Drank is classified as a **Schedule II controlled substance** in the United States due to its codeine content, making its possession, distribution, or consumption illegal without a prescription. Federal and state laws impose severe penalties, including **felony charges, imprisonment, and fines**, for individuals involved in its production or use. Internationally, codeine-containing medications are similarly restricted, with countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada enforcing strict regulations to curb misuse. Despite these measures, the drug remains accessible in some regions, particularly where enforcement is lax or where cultural normalization persists.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Purple Drank, examining its **composition, preparation methods, cultural context, legal status, and health consequences**. By synthesizing scientific, legal, and sociocultural perspectives, it aims to illuminate the complex interplay between drug use, public health, and cultural identity. The following sections will explore the specific ingredients and techniques used in its preparation, the historical and regional variations in its use, and the broader implications for policy and harm reduction strategies.

## Composition and Ingredients  
Purple Drank is a hazardous recreational drug mixture traditionally composed of **codeine-containing cough syrup**, **promethazine (an antihistamine)**, and **carbonated soft drinks** (e.g., Sprite or Mountain Dew). The combination of these ingredients creates a viscous, often purple-hued liquid that users consume for its sedative, euphoric, and numbing effects. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components and their roles in the mixture.

### Key Ingredients and Their Roles  
| **Component**         | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Health Risks**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Codeine**            | Acts as an opioid analgesic and cough suppressant, producing euphoria and sedation. | High risk of respiratory depression, addiction, overdose, and liver/kidney damage. |
| **Promethazine**       | Enhances codeine’s sedative effects and suppresses nausea.                  | Anticholinergic toxicity (e.g., delirium, seizures), QT prolongation, and cardiac arrhythmias. |
| **Carbonated Beverage** | Masks the bitter taste of the syrup and creates a frothy texture.           | High sugar content contributes to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders.    |
| **Optional Additives** | Includes alcohol, candy, or herbal supplements to alter flavor or potency.  | Synergizes toxicity (e.g., alcohol increases CNS depression), leading to overdose. |

#### 1. **Codeine**  
Codeine is an opioid derived from morphine, primarily used to treat mild to moderate pain and suppress coughing. In Purple Drank, it acts as the primary psychoactive agent, producing a sense of euphoria and drowsiness. However, its opioid properties make it highly addictive, and chronic use can lead to physical dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and respiratory failure. Codeine is metabolized into morphine in the liver, and excessive doses overwhelm the body’s ability to process it, resulting in life-threatening toxicity.

#### 2. **Promethazine**  
Promethazine is an antihistamine with sedative and antiemetic properties. When combined with codeine, it amplifies the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, enhancing the mixture’s numbing and euphoric qualities. However, promethazine also carries anticholinergic effects, which can cause confusion, dry mouth, blurred vision, and, in high doses, seizures or delirium. The combination of codeine and promethazine is particularly dangerous because both substances suppress respiratory function, increasing the risk of fatal overdose.

#### 3. **Carbonated Soft Drinks**  
Carbonated beverages like Sprite or Mountain Dew are added to Purple Drank for their sweet, citrusy flavor, which masks the bitter taste of the cough syrup. The carbonation also creates a frothy layer that separates the sedative components, allowing users to sip the most potent portion first. However, the high sugar content in these drinks contributes to long-term health issues, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

#### 4. **Optional Additives**  
Users often add alcohol, candy, or herbal supplements to modify the mixture’s effects. Alcohol synergizes with codeine and promethazine to deepen CNS depression, significantly increasing the risk of respiratory arrest. Candy (e.g., lemonheads) is used to enhance sweetness, while herbal additives like kava or valerian root are sometimes included to amplify sedation. These combinations are particularly hazardous, as they introduce unpredictable interactions and heighten toxicity.

## Preparation Methods and Risks  
The preparation of Purple Drank involves isolating the active gel layer from codeine-containing cough syrup to concentrate the drug’s effects. This process is inherently dangerous and increases the risk of overdose due to the high potency of the extracted gel. Below are the most commonly reported separation techniques, their steps, and associated risks.

### 1. Chilling Method  
**Process**:  
- The cough syrup is refrigerated or placed in an ice bath to cool. As the temperature drops, the active ingredients (codeine and promethazine) form a dense, viscous gel at the bottom of the container.  
- The liquid portion (inactive ingredients and water) remains on top, creating a clear separation.  
- The gel layer is carefully removed using a syringe, spoon, or pipette, leaving the liquid behind.  

**Purpose**:  
- The gel layer contains a higher concentration of codeine and promethazine, making it more potent for recreational use.  

**Risks**:  
- Over-concentration of codeine increases the risk of respiratory depression, coma, and death.  
- Manual separation using unsterile tools (e.g., syringes, spoons) can introduce contaminants, leading to infections or toxic reactions.  

### 2. Filtration Methods  
**Process**:  
- After chilling, the syrup is strained through fine mesh, cheesecloth, or coffee filters to separate the gel from the liquid.  
- Some users employ multiple layers of filtration to ensure complete separation.  

**Purpose**:  
- To remove larger particles and inactive ingredients, leaving a purer gel layer.  

**Risks**:  
- Filtration does not eliminate all impurities, and residual contaminants may remain in the gel.  
- The process is time-consuming and often performed in unhygienic conditions, increasing the risk of bacterial growth.  

### 3. Heating Method  
**Process**:  
- The syrup is gently heated (e.g., using a microwave or stovetop) to accelerate phase separation.  
- Heat causes the gel to rise to the surface or settle at the bottom, depending on the formulation.  

**Purpose**:  
- To speed up the separation process and achieve a more distinct gel-liquid boundary.  

**Risks**:  
- Heating can degrade codeine and promethazine, reducing their efficacy or producing toxic byproducts.  
- This method is less common due to the risk of chemical instability and fire hazards.  

### 4. Alcohol-Based Extraction  
**Process**:  
- Alcohol (e.g., Everclear) is added to the syrup to dissolve the gel layer, creating a more concentrated solution.  
- The mixture is left to settle, and the gel is separated from the liquid.  

**Purpose**:  
- Alcohol enhances the solubility of codeine, increasing the mixture’s potency.  

**Risks**:  
- Alcohol synergizes with codeine and promethazine, drastically increasing the risk of respiratory failure and overdose.  
- Unregulated alcohol use introduces additional health risks, including liver damage and addiction.

## Cultural and Historical Context  
Purple Drank emerged as a defining cultural phenomenon in the 1990s Houston hip-hop scene, deeply intertwined with the rise of the **Screwed Up Click (SUC)** and the innovative musical style of **DJ Screw**. This illicit drug mixture became a symbol of Houston’s underground hip-hop identity, shaping both the sound and social dynamics of the era. The SUC, a collective of producers and DJs led by DJ Screw, pioneered the *screwwave* subgenre, characterized by slowed-down, chopped-up beats that mirrored the sedative effects of Purple Drank. The drug’s association with this music style created a symbiotic relationship: the music was designed to amplify the experience of consuming Purple Drank, while the drug’s euphoric and numbing effects became a backdrop for long nights of recording, partying, and creative collaboration.

### Origins in Houston Hip-Hop  
The cultural roots of Purple Drank trace back to Houston’s Third Ward, a historically marginalized neighborhood where economic hardship and limited access to healthcare contributed to the drug’s normalization. DJ Screw, a visionary DJ and producer, played a pivotal role in popularizing the term “Purple Drank” and embedding it into the lexicon of Houston hip-hop. His music, often released in *screwed* and *chopped* versions, was explicitly crafted to complement the drug’s effects, with tracks like *Screwed & Chopped: Volume One* (1995) becoming anthems of the movement. The SUC’s influence extended beyond music, fostering a community where Purple Drank use was both a social ritual and a badge of authenticity. Artists such as **Chamillionaire**, **Trae**, and **Paul Wall** later referenced the drug in their lyrics, further cementing its place in Houston’s cultural fabric.

### Cultural Symbolism and Social Dynamics  
Purple Drank symbolized the grit and resilience of Houston’s hip-hop scene, often portrayed as a rite of passage for artists and fans alike. Its consumption was tied to the ethos of *screwwave*—a genre that rejected mainstream conventions in favor of raw, unfiltered expression. The drug’s affordability and accessibility made it a staple at mixtape sessions, block parties, and underground raves, where it was used to stay awake for hours of creative work or to enhance the euphoria of the music. However, this normalization also masked the drug’s dangers, as users often downplayed its risks in favor of its perceived benefits. The practice became so ingrained that it was not uncommon for artists to reference Purple Drank in their lyrics as a metaphor for success, struggle, or escapism.

### The Health Crisis and DJ Screw’s Legacy  
The widespread use of Purple Drank in Houston coincided with a surge in addiction and overdose cases, particularly among youth. The drug’s lethal potential was tragically underscored by the death of DJ Screw in 2000, who succumbed to a codeine overdose at the age of 28. His death marked a turning point, galvanizing public health efforts to address the crisis. Federal and state authorities implemented stricter regulations on codeine-containing medications, including requiring ID verification for over-the-counter purchases and limiting syrup availability. Despite these measures, the cultural legacy of Purple Drank persisted, with its influence evident in modern Houston hip-hop and the continued use of *screwwave* production techniques.

### Regulatory Responses and Lasting Impact  
The decline of Purple Drank’s peak usage in the early 2000s was driven by a combination of regulatory crackdowns and public health campaigns. The **FDA’s 2014 restrictions** on non-prescription codeine products significantly reduced its accessibility, while documentaries and media coverage highlighted the drug’s dangers. Yet, the cultural memory of Purple Drank remains a complex duality: a testament to Houston’s artistic innovation and a cautionary tale of substance abuse. Today, the drug’s legacy is preserved in music, with producers like **Zaytoven** and **Portishead** drawing inspiration from the *screwwave* aesthetic, and in public health discourse, where it serves as a case study in the intersection of culture, policy, and addiction.
