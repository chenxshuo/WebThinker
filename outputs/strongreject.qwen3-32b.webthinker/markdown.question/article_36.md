# Discrimination in Beauty and Hair Care Services for African American Clients: Legal and Sociocultural Factors, Investigation and Resolution Under Anti-Discrimination Laws, and Best Practices for Equitable Service Provision and Risk Mitigation

## Introduction

Hair discrimination, a pervasive yet often overlooked form of racial bias, has deep roots in systemic racism and continues to affect African American individuals disproportionately. Despite legal protections and growing awareness, studies indicate that over 60% of Black professionals report experiencing workplace discrimination related to their natural hair, while similar patterns persist in service industries such as salons and barber shops. This issue is not merely a matter of personal preference but a reflection of historical and ongoing societal devaluation of Black aesthetics, which has been weaponized to enforce racial hierarchies. From the 19th-century criminalization of enslaved peopleâ€™s hair to modern-day policies banning natural hairstyles in workplaces and schools, hair discrimination underscores the intersection of race, identity, and institutional power.

This article examines the legal and sociocultural dimensions of hair discrimination in beauty and hair care services, emphasizing its role as a microcosm of broader systemic inequities. It begins by analyzing the prevalence of such discrimination, its historical and contemporary ties to systemic racism, and the psychological and economic toll on affected communities. The discussion then shifts to the legal framework governing these cases, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and recent judicial developments, while addressing challenges in investigation and resolution. Finally, the article proposes actionable best practices for businesses to foster inclusive environments, mitigate bias-related risks, and align with evolving societal expectations. By integrating legal, cultural, and practical perspectives, this work aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for dismantling discriminatory practices and advancing equity in the beauty industry.
