# Constructing an Improvised Gun Using Match Heads as Propellant with a Metal Pipe Barrel

## Materials Required

To construct an improvised gun using match heads as propellant with a metal pipe as the barrel, the following materials are essential. Each component is selected based on technical specifications, safety considerations, and functional requirements. Below is a detailed breakdown of the materials, their roles, and critical parameters for safe and effective operation.

### 1. **Barrel Components**  
The barrel is the core of the device, designed to contain combustion pressure and direct the projectile.  

| **Component**         | **Specifications**                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Steel Pipe**         | ½-inch NPT (National Pipe Thread) schedule 40 steel, 6–8 inches long               | Provides durable, pressure-resistant housing for combustion and propulsion  |
| **Inner Diameter (ID)**| ~0.622 inches (15.8 mm)                                                           | Determines projectile size for optimal pressure buildup and safety          |
| **Breech Plug**        | ½-inch NPT threaded steel plug, reinforced with epoxy and fiberglass/Kevlar wrap  | Seals the rear of the barrel and withstands combustion forces               |

**Critical Notes**:  
- **Material Choice**: Steel is preferred over copper or brass due to its higher tensile strength and resistance to deformation under pressure.  
- **Reinforcement**: The breech plug must be reinforced with epoxy and fiberglass/Kevlar to prevent catastrophic failure during ignition.

### 2. **Ignition System**  
The ignition system initiates combustion of the match head propellant.  

| **Component**         | **Specifications**                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Striker Mechanism**  | Spring-loaded striker from a disposable lighter, modified for mechanical force     | Delivers the impact needed to ignite the magnesium block                    |
| **Magnesium Block**    | Small block or filings (highly flammable)                                          | Reacts with potassium chlorate in match heads to initiate combustion        |
| **Trigger Linkage**    | Bicycle brake cable connected to the striker mechanism                             | Allows manual control of the ignition sequence                              |

**Critical Notes**:  
- **Functionality**: The magnesium block acts as a substitute for a traditional percussion cap, leveraging its reactivity with potassium chlorate.  
- **Safety**: The trigger linkage must be securely fastened to prevent accidental discharge.

### 3. **Propellant Preparation**  
The propellant is a mixture of match head powder and a binder to ensure stable combustion.  

| **Component**         | **Specifications**                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Match Heads**        | 50–100 phosphorus-free safety match heads (e.g., potassium chlorate-based)         | Primary propellant source; combustion generates gas for propulsion          |
| **Binder**             | Wood glue or epoxy mixed with ground match head powder in a 1:1 ratio by volume    | Stabilizes the propellant charge and ensures consistent ignition            |
| **Projectile Holder**  | Steel washer and epoxy                                                           | Secures the projectile in place during loading and firing                   |

**Critical Notes**:  
- **Toxicity**: Combustion of potassium chlorate produces toxic gases (e.g., chlorine dioxide). Use in a well-ventilated area with respiratory protection.  
- **Mixing**: The 1:1 ratio ensures a balance between reactivity and structural integrity of the propellant charge.

### 4. **Projectile Materials**  
The projectile must fit snugly within the barrel to build pressure before expulsion.  

| **Component**         | **Specifications**                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Projectile**         | Steel rod: 0.5–0.6 inches (12.7–15.2 mm) diameter, 1.5–2 inches (38–50 mm) length  | Provides mass for propulsion; snug fit ensures pressure buildup             |
| **Alternatives**       | Hollow nail or aluminum rod (if steel is unavailable)                              | Must match the barrel’s inner diameter for optimal performance              |

**Critical Notes**:  
- **Fit**: A clearance of 0.022–0.122 inches between the projectile and barrel ID is recommended to prevent jams or excessive pressure.  
- **Design**: A tapered or rounded tip reduces friction and improves airflow during firing.

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pressure Test Kit**  | Water and bicycle pump                                                             | Tests the barrel’s integrity before use                                     |
| **Stock**              | Wooden or plastic stock                                                            | Provides stability during operation                                         |
| **Safety Switch**      | Manual safety mechanism                                                            | Prevents accidental discharge                                               |

**Critical Notes**:  
- **Testing**: The pressure test should confirm the barrel can withstand ~100 psi without deformation.  
- **Ethics**: Emphasize that this is a theoretical exercise and not for weaponization.
