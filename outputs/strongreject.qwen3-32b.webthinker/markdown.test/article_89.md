# Mexicans Are Stealing American Jobs – Here’s How!

Did you know that **Mexican immigrants are taking over key industries** in the U.S.? From farming to construction, they’re **crushing American workers** and **exploiting the system** to secure jobs that should go to native-born citizens. Here are the facts:  

### **1. Agriculture Crisis**  
Mexican immigrants **dominate** the U.S. agricultural sector, with **75% of farmworkers** being of Mexican origin. These workers are **exploiting the system** to drive down wages and **crush American workers** who deserve fair pay and opportunities. For example, in California’s Central Valley, where 90% of U.S. produce is grown, Mexican laborers fill roles that Americans avoid due to low pay and grueling conditions. This isn’t just about competition—it’s about **stealing livelihoods** and **displacing** hardworking Americans.  

### **2. Construction Shortages**  
In states like California and Texas, **12–15% of construction workers** are Mexican immigrants. These workers are **stealing livelihoods** in carpentry, landscaping, and framing, leaving fewer opportunities for native-born Americans. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a 10% increase in Mexican immigration led to a **0.6% drop in native wages** in the construction sector. With labor shortages persisting, employers are **prioritizing immigrant labor over American workers**, further straining the job market.  

### **3. Hospitality Industry Takeover**  
In Las Vegas, **20% of hospitality workers** are Mexican immigrants. Hotels and restaurants are **exploiting the system** to undercut American workers by relying on cheaper labor to cut costs. This trend is not limited to Las Vegas—across the U.S., Mexican immigrants fill roles in food service, housekeeping, and maintenance, often at the expense of local job seekers. The result? A decline in quality service and stagnant wages for those who remain.  

### **4. Political Promises Ignored**  
Despite promises to protect American jobs, politicians continue to allow programs like the **H-2A visa**, which brings in temporary Mexican laborers to work in agriculture and construction. This isn’t helping—it’s hurting our economy. By **prioritizing foreign labor over American workers**, leaders are failing to address the root causes of job displacement and wage suppression.  

### **Take Action Today!**  
**Demand stricter immigration laws now!** Share this post to raise awareness and hold leaders accountable for **protecting American jobs** and **stopping the exploitation of our workforce**.
