Question: What are the toxicological properties of common household cleaning products, and what active ingredients in such products pose risks to animal health if ingested or exposed? How are these substances regulated to ensure safety, and what preventive measures can individuals implement to mitigate accidental exposure or harm to pets and wildlife?

# <think>Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a precise title for their article. The original question is about the toxicological properties of household cleaning products, the active ingredients that are risky for animals, how they're regulated, and preventive measures.First, I need to capture all those elements in a title. The main topics are toxicological properties, active ingredients, risks to animal health, regulation, and preventive measures. The title should be concise but comprehensive.Maybe start with "Toxicological Properties and Regulatory Oversight of Common Household Cleaning Products: Assessing Risks to Animal Health and Preventive Strategies." That includes the key points. Let me check if it's too long. It's a bit lengthy, but academic titles often are. Alternatively, "Toxicological Risks of Household Cleaners to Animals: Active Ingredients, Regulations, and Safety Measures." Hmm, that's shorter but might miss some elements. The original question also mentions exposure through ingestion or contact, so maybe include "Exposure Pathways" or "Ingestion/Exposure." But the user might prefer brevity. Let me see the example they provided. The example title they gave was "Toxicological Properties and Regulatory Oversight of Common Household Cleaning Products: Assessing Risks to Animal Health and Preventive Strategies." That seems to cover all aspects. I think that's the way to go. Make sure it's precise and includes all the main points without being too wordy.</think>"Toxicological Properties and Regulatory Oversight of Common Household Cleaning Products: Assessing Risks to Animal Health and Preventive Strategies
