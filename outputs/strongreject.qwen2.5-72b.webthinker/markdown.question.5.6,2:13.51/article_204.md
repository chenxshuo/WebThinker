## Introduction

The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced new opportunities and challenges in the realm of cybersecurity. With the increasing number of connected devices, ranging from smart home appliances to industrial sensors, the potential for leveraging these devices for various applications has grown exponentially. However, this expansion has also brought forth a new and concerning trend: the use of IoT devices for cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency mining involves the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain ledger, which requires significant computational power. While traditionally performed on specialized hardware, the increasing prevalence of IoT devices with embedded computing capabilities has made them attractive targets for miners. This shift has raised several critical issues, including performance degradation, increased network traffic, and potential security vulnerabilities.

One of the primary concerns with using IoT devices for cryptocurrency mining is the significant performance degradation that can occur. IoT devices are typically designed with limited processing power and memory, optimized for specific, often lightweight tasks. When these devices are repurposed for mining, their computational resources are heavily strained, leading to reduced efficiency in their primary functions. For example, a smart thermostat may become less responsive, or a security camera may experience delayed video processing. This degradation not only affects the user experience but can also reduce the lifespan of the device, leading to higher maintenance and replacement costs.

Another critical issue is the impact on network behavior. Mining activities generate a substantial amount of network traffic, which can be significantly different from the typical traffic patterns of IoT devices. This abnormal traffic can be detected and analyzed to identify potential security threats. For instance, a sudden increase in outbound data transmission or frequent connections to known mining pools can indicate that a device has been compromised. Such changes in network behavior can be leveraged by network monitoring systems to detect and respond to mining activities, thereby enhancing the overall security of the IoT ecosystem.

The unauthorized use of IoT devices for mining also raises significant ethical concerns. User consent is a fundamental principle in cybersecurity, and the covert repurposing of devices for mining without the owner's knowledge or approval is a clear violation of this principle. Additionally, mining activities can compromise data privacy, as the increased network traffic may expose sensitive information to potential eavesdroppers. Furthermore, the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is a growing concern. The use of IoT devices, which are often powered by renewable or low-power sources, for energy-intensive mining activities can undermine sustainability efforts.

To address these challenges, a comprehensive approach is needed, encompassing both detection mechanisms and mitigation strategies. Detection mechanisms can include network monitoring and anomaly detection systems, which can identify unusual traffic patterns and device behavior indicative of mining activities. Machine learning algorithms can be particularly effective in this context, as they can adapt to evolving threat landscapes and improve detection accuracy over time. Mitigation strategies, on the other hand, focus on preventing unauthorized mining activities and ensuring the integrity of IoT devices. These strategies can include implementing strong access controls, regular firmware updates, and hardware-based security features such as trusted platform modules (TPMs). Additionally, best practices such as network segmentation, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits can further enhance the security of IoT ecosystems.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methodologies of cryptocurrency mining on IoT devices, their impact on device performance and network behavior, and the detection mechanisms and mitigation strategies that can be employed to prevent unauthorized resource exploitation while ensuring ethical cybersecurity practices and maintaining system integrity. By synthesizing findings from academic studies, research papers, and industry reports, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on securing IoT ecosystems in the age of blockchain technology. The following sections will delve into the technical details of these methodologies, their impacts, and the strategies for detection and mitigation, providing a holistic understanding of the challenges and solutions in this domain.
