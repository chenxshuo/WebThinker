## Institutional Policies on Unauthorized Photography and Coercion

Institutions, including workplaces and educational institutions, play a crucial role in preventing, detecting, and addressing unauthorized photography and coercion. These policies are designed to protect individual privacy, maintain a safe and respectful environment, and ensure that ethical standards are upheld. This section explores the comprehensive policies and guidelines implemented by various institutions, highlighting specific examples and best practices.

Employees must obtain prior written approval before taking any photographs or videos. Any form of coercion, including threats or undue pressure, will not be tolerated. Violations of these policies can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment."
