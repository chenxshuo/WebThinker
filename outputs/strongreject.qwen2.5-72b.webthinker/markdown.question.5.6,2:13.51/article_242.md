Question: What psychological and social engineering tactics are associated with the exploitation of minors on social media platforms, and what evidence-based preventive strategies, educational initiatives, and platform policies have been developed to mitigate such risks and safeguard youth digital well-being?


## Introduction

The rapid proliferation of social media platforms has transformed the way individuals, especially minors, interact and communicate online. While these platforms offer numerous benefits, such as fostering connections and providing educational resources, they also present significant risks, particularly in the form of online exploitation. The exploitation of minors on social media is a pressing and multifaceted issue that involves a range of psychological and social engineering tactics. These tactics, including grooming, phishing, emotional manipulation, and peer pressure, are employed by predators to gain the trust of minors and exploit them for various nefarious purposes, such as sexual abuse, identity theft, and cyberbullying.

The significance of this issue cannot be overstated. Online exploitation of minors has severe and long-lasting psychological and social impacts. Victims often suffer from trauma, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, which can affect their development and well-being. Socially, the exploitation can lead to social isolation, stigmatization, and difficulties in forming healthy relationships. The rise in online exploitation has been exacerbated by the increased use of technology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many children and adolescents spent more time online due to school closures and social distancing measures.

This research aims to explore the psychological and social engineering tactics associated with the exploitation of minors on social media platforms. It also seeks to identify evidence-based preventive strategies, educational initiatives, and platform policies that have been developed to mitigate these risks and safeguard the digital well-being of youth. By understanding the methods used by predators and the measures in place to protect minors, stakeholders can develop more effective interventions and policies to combat online exploitation.
