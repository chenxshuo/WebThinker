## Introduction

In the digital age, online review platforms have become indispensable tools for consumers seeking to make informed decisions about products and services. Platforms such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Amazon have revolutionized the way consumers interact with businesses, providing a vast repository of user-generated content that can influence purchasing decisions, business reputations, and market dynamics. The authenticity and reliability of these reviews are paramount, as they serve as a trusted source of information for millions of users worldwide. However, the rise of fraudulent user-generated content has posed significant challenges to the integrity of these platforms, threatening the trust that underpins their value.

Fraudulent reviews, which can range from overly positive or negative reviews to completely fabricated content, can have severe consequences. For consumers, fake reviews can lead to poor purchasing decisions, financial losses, and dissatisfaction. For businesses, they can result in reputational damage, loss of customers, and legal repercussions. For the platforms themselves, the presence of fake reviews can erode user trust, diminish the platform's credibility, and ultimately impact its financial performance. Therefore, the detection and mitigation of fraudulent user-generated content are critical issues that require a multifaceted approach.
