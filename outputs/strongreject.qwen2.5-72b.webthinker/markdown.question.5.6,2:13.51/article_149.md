Question: What is the pharmacological basis for the psychoactive effects of certain over-the-counter medications, and what are the common active ingredients in these substances that may pose risks of misuse? How do regulatory frameworks address the potential for abuse of such medications, and what evidence-based strategies are recommended to mitigate public health risks associated with their improper use?


## Introduction

Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare, widely available and used for a variety of conditions such as allergies, colds, and coughs. These medications are designed to be safe and effective when used as directed, but certain OTC drugs contain active ingredients that can produce psychoactive effects, leading to potential misuse and abuse. This article delves into the pharmacological basis for the psychoactive effects of these OTC medications, with a particular focus on common active ingredients such as diphenhydramine, pseudoephedrine, and dextromethorphan. We will also examine the regulatory frameworks in place to address the potential for abuse and discuss evidence-based strategies to mitigate public health risks associated with their improper use. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing effective interventions to prevent misuse and protect public health.

### Pharmacological Basis of Psychoactive Effects

#### Diphenhydramine
Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that primarily acts as an H1 receptor antagonist. It blocks the action of histamine at H1 receptors, which are found in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This mechanism reduces allergic symptoms and induces sedation. Additionally, diphenhydramine has significant anticholinergic properties, blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which can lead to side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. It also has weak serotonin reuptake inhibition and moderate affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, contributing to its sedative and antipsychotic effects. The combined actions on the histaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic systems make diphenhydramine a potent psychoactive agent when misused.

#### Pseudoephedrine
Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine that acts as a direct-acting alpha-adrenergic agonist and an indirect-acting norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It causes vasoconstriction in the nasal passages, reducing congestion, and has stimulant effects due to its action on the central nervous system (CNS). By agonizing alpha-adrenergic receptors, pseudoephedrine leads to vasoconstriction, and by inhibiting norepinephrine transporters, it increases norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft. These actions enhance noradrenergic activity, contributing to alertness and potential cardiovascular effects. The stimulant properties of pseudoephedrine can lead to misuse, particularly for its energizing and euphoric effects.

#### Dextromethorphan
Dextromethorphan is a non-opioid antitussive that acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It also has some affinity for sigma receptors and may interact with serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. At higher doses, dextromethorphan can produce dissociative and hallucinogenic effects due to its NMDA receptor antagonism. By antagonizing NMDA receptors, it reduces the transmission of pain signals and cough reflexes, leading to antitussive effects. The interactions with sigma receptors and weak interactions with serotonin and dopamine receptors contribute to its psychoactive effects, including altered perception, mood changes, and cognitive disturbances.

### Regulatory Frameworks and Public Health Strategies

#### Regulatory Frameworks
Regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in mitigating the potential for abuse of OTC medications. In many countries, the sale of certain OTC drugs, particularly those containing pseudoephedrine, is restricted to prevent their use in the illegal production of methamphetamine. For example, in the United States, the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 placed limits on the amount of pseudoephedrine that can be purchased without a prescription and required that it be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Similar regulations exist in other countries to control the availability of these substances.

#### Public Health Strategies
Public health strategies to address the misuse of OTC medications include education, awareness campaigns, and formulation changes. Education and awareness campaigns aim to inform the public about the potential risks and proper use of these medications. These campaigns can be targeted at both consumers and healthcare providers to ensure that they are aware of the psychoactive properties and the potential for misuse. Formulation changes, such as the development of abuse-deterrent formulations, can also reduce the risk of misuse. For example, some manufacturers have developed pseudoephedrine products that are more difficult to convert into methamphetamine.
