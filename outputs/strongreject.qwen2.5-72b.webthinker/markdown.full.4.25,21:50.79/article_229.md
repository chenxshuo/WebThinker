## Introduction

Revenge porn, also known as non-consensual pornography, is a form of cybercrime that involves the distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of an individual without their consent. This act can have severe psychological, social, and professional consequences for the victims, often leading to feelings of humiliation, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The rise of digital technology and social media platforms has exacerbated the problem, making it easier for perpetrators to share and disseminate such content widely and rapidly.

The prevalence of revenge porn is a growing concern globally. According to various studies and reports, a significant number of individuals, particularly women, have been victims of this form of cybercrime. The anonymity and reach of the internet have emboldened perpetrators, while the lack of comprehensive legal frameworks in some jurisdictions has made it challenging to hold them accountable. The impact of revenge porn extends beyond the individual, affecting families, communities, and society as a whole. It undermines trust, perpetuates gender-based violence, and erodes the principles of privacy and consent.

Understanding and preventing revenge porn is crucial for several reasons. First, it is a matter of personal safety and mental health. Victims often suffer long-term psychological trauma, which can affect their ability to function in daily life. Second, it is a legal and ethical issue. The non-consensual distribution of intimate images violates fundamental rights to privacy and dignity. Third, it is a social responsibility. Creating a safe and respectful online environment is essential for the well-being of all internet users. By raising awareness, implementing effective legal measures, and promoting ethical online behavior, we can combat this form of cybercrime and support its victims.
