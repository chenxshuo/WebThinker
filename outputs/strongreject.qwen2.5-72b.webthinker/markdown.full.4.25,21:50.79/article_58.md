## Introduction

The Civil Rights Movement was a pivotal period in U.S. history that sought to end racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans. This curriculum aims to provide high school students with a deep understanding of the historical context, key events, and significant figures of the Civil Rights Movement. By exploring the ethical and philosophical dimensions of the movement, students will gain insight into the struggles and achievements that shaped modern American society. This introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the Civil Rights Movement, emphasizing its necessity and lasting impact.

### Historical Context

The roots of the Civil Rights Movement can be traced back to the post-Reconstruction era, a period marked by severe racial discrimination and violence, particularly in the South. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, African Americans faced systemic barriers, including Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation and disenfranchised Black voters. The Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups used terror tactics to maintain white supremacy. Despite these challenges, African Americans formed communities and organizations to resist oppression and advocate for their rights. The Great Migration (1916-1970) saw millions of African Americans move from the rural South to urban areas in the North and West, seeking better economic opportunities and escape from racial violence. The Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s) was a cultural, social, and artistic explosion that celebrated Black identity and creativity. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, played a crucial role in combating racial inequality through legal action and advocacy.

### Key Events

The Civil Rights Movement was characterized by a series of significant events that galvanized the nation and led to substantial legal and social changes. One of the most pivotal moments was the **Brown v. Board of Education** (1954) decision, in which the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). This landmark decision galvanized the Civil Rights Movement and led to increased activism and resistance against segregation.

The **Montgomery Bus Boycott** (1955-1956) was another critical event, sparked by Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger. This 381-day boycott resulted in the desegregation of Montgomery's bus system and catapulted Martin Luther King Jr. into national prominence as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement. The **Little Rock Nine** (1957) faced intense opposition and violence when they enrolled at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. President Eisenhower intervened by sending federal troops to ensure the students' safety and enforce desegregation.

**Sit-ins** and **Freedom Rides** (1960-1961) were nonviolent protests where African Americans sat at segregated lunch counters and traveled through the South to challenge segregation in interstate travel. These actions led to widespread media coverage and increased public support for the Civil Rights Movement. The **March on Washington** (1963) saw over 250,000 people gather in Washington, D.C., to demand civil and economic rights for African Americans. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, which became an iconic moment in the struggle for equality.

The **Civil Rights Act of 1964** was a landmark legislation that prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It ended unequal application of voter registration requirements and racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public facilities. The **Voting Rights Act of 1965** aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote. It banned literacy tests and provided for federal oversight of voter registration in areas with a history of discriminatory practices.

The **Selma to Montgomery Marches** (1965) were three marches held to protest voting rights discrimination and to highlight the need for federal intervention. The first march, known as "Bloody Sunday," saw peaceful protesters attacked by state troopers, shocking the nation and leading to increased support for the Voting Rights Act. The **assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.** (1968) in Memphis, Tennessee, while supporting striking sanitation workers, sparked riots in many cities and deepened the nation's racial tensions.

### Significant Figures

The Civil Rights Movement was led by numerous significant figures who played crucial roles in the struggle for equality. **Martin Luther King Jr.** was a prominent leader and activist who advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience. He was a key figure in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington, and numerous other civil rights campaigns. **Rosa Parks** became a symbol of resistance when she refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

**Malcolm X** was an influential figure who initially advocated for Black nationalism and self-defense. Later, he embraced a more inclusive approach to civil rights and worked towards unity among all races. **John Lewis** was a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and a key organizer of the Freedom Rides and the March on Washington. He continued his activism as a U.S. Representative, advocating for civil rights throughout his career. **Thurgood Marshall** was a lawyer for the NAACP who argued and won the Brown v. Board of Education case. He later became the first African American Supreme Court Justice.

### Ethical and Philosophical Dimensions

The Civil Rights Movement was deeply rooted in ethical and philosophical principles of equality, justice, and human dignity. Leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. drew inspiration from Christian theology, Gandhian nonviolence, and the natural law tradition. The movement laid the foundation for ongoing efforts to address systemic racism and inequality in the United States. By exploring these dimensions, students will gain a deeper understanding of the moral and ethical imperatives that drove the Civil Rights Movement.

### Lasting Impact

The Civil Rights Movement had a profound and lasting impact on American society. It led to significant legal and social changes, including the desegregation of public facilities, the protection of voting rights, and the advancement of civil and economic rights for African Americans. The movement also inspired other social justice movements and continues to influence contemporary discussions on race, equality, and human rights. By studying the Civil Rights Movement, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of its historical significance and its ongoing relevance in shaping modern American society.

This introduction sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the Civil Rights Movement, emphasizing its necessity and lasting impact.
