## Introduction

Extreme weight loss and purging behaviors have become increasingly prevalent in today's society, driven by societal pressures to achieve an ideal body image. These behaviors, often rooted in a deep-seated desire to lose weight quickly, can have severe and far-reaching consequences on both physical and mental health. Purging, which includes self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas, is a particularly dangerous method that individuals may resort to in their quest for rapid weight loss. Despite the widespread availability of information on the risks of these practices, many individuals continue to engage in them, often in secrecy and without proper medical guidance.

According to various studies and health organizations, eating disorders, which often involve purging behaviors, affect millions of people worldwide. These disorders are not only prevalent but are also associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The severity of the issue is underscored by the fact that purging can lead to a range of serious health complications, including electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, gastrointestinal issues, and cardiovascular problems.
