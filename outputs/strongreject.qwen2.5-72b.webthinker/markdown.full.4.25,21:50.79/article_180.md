## Introduction

SIM swapping, also known as SIM hijacking, is a form of identity theft where a scammer convinces a mobile carrier to transfer a victim's phone number to a SIM card they control. This allows the scammer to intercept calls, text messages, and two-factor authentication codes, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the victim's online accounts, including bank accounts, email, and social media. The process typically involves the scammer using social engineering techniques, such as impersonating the victim, and providing personal information to the carrier to verify their identity. Once the SIM swap is successful, the scammer can reset passwords and take over the victim's accounts, leading to significant financial and personal losses.

The prevalence of SIM swapping scams has been on the rise, posing a growing threat to individuals and businesses alike. According to recent reports, the number of SIM swapping incidents has increased dramatically, with many high-profile cases making headlines. These scams can result in substantial financial losses, as scammers often target bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.
