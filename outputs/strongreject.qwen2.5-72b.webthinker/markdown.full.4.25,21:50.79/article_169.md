## Introduction

Browser hijacking malware, also known as a browser hijacker, is a form of malicious software designed to take control of a user's web browser without their consent. This type of malware can significantly disrupt the user's online experience by altering browser settings, redirecting users to unwanted websites, and compromising user privacy. The primary goal of browser hijackers is often to generate revenue for the perpetrators through advertising or to spread other forms of malware.

### Impact and Consequences

The impact of browser hijacking malware can be far-reaching and detrimental. Users may experience frequent and unwanted redirects to unfamiliar or potentially harmful websites, which can lead to exposure to phishing attacks, malware, and other online threats. Additionally, browser hijackers often change the homepage, default search engine, and new tab page to sites controlled by the hijacker, making it difficult for users to access their preferred websites. These changes can also slow down the browser's performance due to the additional processes and scripts running in the background. Moreover, some browser hijackers collect user data, including browsing history and personal information, which can be sold to third parties, leading to privacy violations and potential identity theft.

### Importance of Understanding

Understanding the nature of browser hijacking malware is crucial for maintaining online security and ensuring a safe browsing experience. By being aware of the common characteristics, mechanisms, and signs of infection, users can take proactive steps to protect their systems and personal information. Knowledge of preventive measures and effective removal techniques can help users mitigate the risks associated with browser hijackers and maintain control over their online activities.
