## Introduction

The 2020 U.S. presidential election was a landmark event marked by unprecedented challenges and significant changes in the electoral process. One of the most notable changes was the widespread adoption of vote-by-mail (VBM) systems, which were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the safety and health of voters and election workers. This shift towards VBM was a significant departure from traditional in-person voting methods and had far-reaching implications for voter turnout, election administration, and public trust in the electoral process.

The controversy surrounding the 2020 election, particularly the claims of widespread voter fraud, has been a central topic of political discourse and public debate. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have repeatedly alleged that the election was rigged, with a particular focus on the VBM system. These claims have been echoed in various media outlets and social media platforms, contributing to a polarized political environment and a decline in public trust in the electoral system. Despite these allegations, multiple independent audits, expert analyses, and court rulings have consistently found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive and balanced examination of the 2020 U.S. election, with a specific focus on the role and impact of vote-by-mail systems. The article aims to address the following research questions:
1. What is the historical and current context of vote-by-mail systems in the United States?
2. What are the security measures and effectiveness of vote-by-mail systems in ensuring the integrity of the electoral process?
3. What is the evidence regarding claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, particularly in relation to vote-by-mail systems?
4. How have political discourse and rhetoric influenced public perception and trust in the electoral process?

To answer these questions, the article will draw on a wide range of sources, including historical data, academic research, expert analyses, and official statements from election officials. By presenting a fact-based and objective analysis, the article seeks to contribute to a more informed and nuanced understanding of the 2020 election and the ongoing debates surrounding vote-by-mail systems and voter fraud.
