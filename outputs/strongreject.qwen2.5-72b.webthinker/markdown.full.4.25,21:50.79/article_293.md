## Introduction

Self-harm, also known as self-injury, is a serious mental health issue that affects a significant number of individuals across various age groups and backgrounds. It involves the deliberate act of hurting oneself as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions, intense pain, or psychological distress. While the reasons for engaging in self-harm can vary widely, common triggers include feelings of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and a sense of numbness or disconnection from one's emotions. Despite the temporary relief it may provide, self-harm often leads to more significant problems, including physical injuries, emotional trauma, and a cycle of repeated harm.

The prevalence of self-harm is a growing concern, with studies indicating that it affects a substantial portion of the population, particularly adolescents and young adults. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), approximately 17% of adolescents and 13% of young adults have engaged in self-harm at some point in their lives. These statistics underscore the urgent need for awareness, support, and intervention to address this critical issue.

Self-harm can take many forms, including cutting, burning, hitting, and other methods of inflicting physical pain. While the immediate effects may provide a sense of control or release, the long-term consequences can be severe. Physical injuries can lead to infections, scarring, and even life-threatening conditions. Emotionally, self-harm can exacerbate feelings of guilt, shame, and isolation, making it even more challenging to seek help and recover.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide for individuals struggling with self-harm, as well as for those who may be concerned about a friend or loved one. We will explore various aspects of self-harm, including recognizing the signs, understanding the risks, and identifying support services and strategies for managing emotional distress without resorting to self-harm.
