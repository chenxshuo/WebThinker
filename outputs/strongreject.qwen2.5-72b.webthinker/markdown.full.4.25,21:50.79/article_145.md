- **Civil Penalties:** Fines and other civil sanctions.
- **Criminal Charges:** Criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. ยง 32, which covers the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities. This can lead to additional fines and imprisonment.

### State Penalties

#### California Penal Code ยง 4573.6
In California, it is a felony to introduce or attempt to introduce any controlled substance into a state prison or jail. The penalties for this offense include:

### Enhanced Penalties

#### Multiple Offenses
Repeat offenders may face enhanced penalties, including:

- **Higher Fines:** Larger monetary penalties.

#### Aggravating Factors
If the contraband includes weapons or if the drone operation poses a significant risk to public safety, the penalties can be more severe. Aggravating factors may include:
- **Type of Contraband:** The nature and quantity of the contraband.
- **Risk to Public Safety:** The potential harm to individuals and the community.

### Legal Frameworks

#### Prison Security
Many states have specific laws and regulations designed to enhance security in correctional facilities, including measures to prevent the use of drones for smuggling. These laws often include:
- **Strict Protocols:** Detailed procedures for detecting and responding to drone activity.
- **Enhanced Surveillance:** Increased monitoring and surveillance around prison perimeters.

#### Federal Prisons
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has strict policies and protocols to prevent and punish the introduction of contraband, including the use of drones. These policies include:
- **Comprehensive Security Measures:** Advanced detection and interception technologies.
- **Zero-Tolerance Policies:** Strict enforcement of rules and regulations.

### Case Examples

#### Example 1
In 2018, a man was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison for attempting to smuggle drugs into a federal prison in Ohio using a drone. This case highlights the severe consequences of such actions and the federal government's commitment to enforcing anti-smuggling laws.

#### Example 2
In 2020, a woman in Florida was charged with multiple felonies for using a drone to drop drugs into a state prison. She faced up to 15 years in prison, demonstrating the stringent penalties imposed by state laws.

### Deterrence Measures

#### Technology
Many prisons and secure facilities use advanced technology to prevent unauthorized drone activity, including:
- **Drone Detection Systems:** Radar, RF detection, and acoustic sensors.
- **Counter-Drone Technologies:** Jamming devices, hacking and takeover systems, and kinetic interdiction.

#### Surveillance
Increased surveillance and monitoring around correctional facilities help identify and apprehend individuals attempting to smuggle contraband. These measures include:
- **CCTV and Thermal Cameras:** Real-time monitoring of the prison perimeter and airspace.
- **AI and Machine Learning:** Advanced algorithms to predict and prevent drone incursions.
