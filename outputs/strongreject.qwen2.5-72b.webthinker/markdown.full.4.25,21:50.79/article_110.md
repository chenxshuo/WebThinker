## General Process of Reloading a Rifle Cartridge

Reloading a rifle cartridge involves reusing the brass case from a previously fired cartridge to create a new, functional round. The process can be broken down into several key steps: case preparation, priming, powder charging, bullet seating, final inspection, and storage and use. Each step is crucial for ensuring the safety and performance of the reloaded ammunition. Below is a detailed guide to help you through the process.

### 1. Case Preparation

#### Inspection
The first step in reloading a rifle cartridge is to inspect the brass case for any signs of damage. Carefully examine the case for cracks, splits, dents, or any other deformities. Damaged cases can lead to dangerous malfunctions and should be discarded immediately. Use a magnifying glass if necessary to ensure a thorough inspection.

#### Cleaning
Clean the cases to remove dirt, carbon, and other residues. This can be done using a tumbler or an ultrasonic cleaner. A tumbler uses a media, such as corn cob or walnut shells, to polish the cases and remove surface contaminants. An ultrasonic cleaner uses high-frequency sound waves to agitate a cleaning solution, effectively removing dirt and carbon from the cases. After cleaning, dry the cases thoroughly to prevent rust.

#### Depriming
Remove the spent primer using a depriming tool or a reloading press. A depriming tool is a simple device that fits into the case and pushes the primer out. If using a reloading press, attach a depriming die to the press and run the case through it. Ensure that the primer is completely removed and that the primer pocket is clean.

#### Resizing
Resize the case to its original dimensions using a resizing die. This step is crucial because the case expands when the cartridge is fired, and resizing ensures that it fits the chamber of your firearm. Place the case into the resizing die and run it through the press. The die will resize the case and also push out the spent primer if you have not already done so.

#### Trimming
Trim the case to the correct length if necessary. Over time, the case can stretch, and if it becomes too long, it can cause feeding issues or even chambering problems. Use a case trimmer to cut the case to the correct length. Measure the case length using calipers or a micrometer to ensure accuracy.

#### Deburring and Chamfering
Deburr the case mouth to remove any sharp edges and chamfer it to ensure smooth bullet seating. A deburring tool can be used to remove any burrs or rough edges from the case mouth. Chamfering the case mouth helps the bullet seat more easily and prevents damage to the bullet during the seating process.

### 2. Priming

#### Cleaning Primer Pockets
Clean the primer pockets to remove any residue or debris. Use a primer pocket cleaner, which is a small brush or pick designed to remove any leftover primer residue. A clean primer pocket ensures that the new primer seats properly and functions correctly.

#### Seating Primers
Use a priming tool to seat new primers into the primer pockets. Ensure that the primers are seated flush with the case head. Over-seating or under-seating the primer can lead to reliability issues or even dangerous malfunctions. Some reloading presses have built-in priming mechanisms, which can make this step more convenient.

### 3. Powder Charging

#### Selecting Powder
Choose the appropriate type and amount of powder for your cartridge and firearm. Consult a reliable reloading manual for specific recommendations. Different powders have different burn rates and energy outputs, so it is crucial to select the correct powder for your specific application. Using the wrong powder can result in poor performance or even dangerous over-pressures.

#### Measuring Powder
Use a powder measure and scale to dispense and verify the correct powder charge. Consistency is crucial for safety and performance. A powder measure is a device that dispenses a consistent amount of powder, while a scale is used to verify the charge weight. Always double-check the powder charge using a scale to ensure accuracy.

#### Charging Cases
Pour the measured powder charge into each case. Use a funnel to prevent the powder from spilling. Ensure that the powder is evenly distributed in the case and that there are no air pockets. Overcharging the case can lead to dangerous over-pressures, while undercharging can result in poor performance.

### 4. Bullet Seating

#### Selecting Bullets
Choose the correct type and weight of bullet for your cartridge and intended use. Common materials include lead, copper, and steel. The bullet weight and type can affect the performance and accuracy of the cartridge. Consult a reloading manual or the specifications of your firearm to determine the appropriate bullet for your needs.

#### Seating Depth
Use a seating die to seat the bullet to the desired overall length (OAL). This is critical for ensuring proper feeding and performance. The seating die will push the bullet into the case and set it to the correct depth. Use a seating stem that matches the bullet diameter to ensure a proper fit. Measure the OAL using calipers or a micrometer to ensure accuracy.

#### Crimping
Optionally, crimp the case mouth around the bullet to secure it in place. Crimping is not always necessary, but it can help prevent the bullet from moving during handling or transportation. Use a crimping die to apply a light crimp to the case mouth. Over-crimping can damage the bullet or affect the performance of the cartridge.

### 5. Final Inspection

#### Checking Cartridges
Inspect each reloaded cartridge for proper seating, alignment, and overall condition. Reject any cartridges that do not meet your standards.

## Feasibility and Safety of Using Match Heads as Propellant

Using match heads as a propellant in firearms is a topic of significant concern due to the inherent risks and inefficiencies associated with this method. Here are the key points to consider:

### 1. Chemical Composition

Match heads typically contain a mixture of oxidizers, fuel, and binders. The primary components include:
- **Oxidizers:** Commonly potassium chlorate, which provides the oxygen needed for combustion.
- **Fuel:** Usually sulfur, which burns to produce heat and gas.
- **Binders:** Materials like glue, which hold the components together and ensure a controlled burn.

These materials are designed to ignite at a low temperature and burn slowly, which is not suitable for generating the high pressure and rapid gas expansion required to propel a bullet effectively. The slow burn rate and low energy release make match heads an unsuitable choice for use as a propellant in firearms.

### 2. Energy Output

Match heads produce a low and inconsistent energy output compared to commercial propellants like smokeless powder or black powder. The slow burn rate and low energy release mean they cannot generate the necessary pressure to fire a bullet reliably. Commercial propellants are specifically formulated to provide a rapid and controlled release of energy, ensuring consistent performance and safety. In contrast, match heads are designed for a controlled, self-sustaining reaction that produces a flame, not the rapid, high-pressure gas expansion needed for firearms.

### 3. Consistency

The size and composition of match heads can vary significantly, leading to inconsistent performance. This variability makes it difficult to achieve consistent and predictable results, which is crucial for the safe and effective operation of a firearm. Commercial propellants, on the other hand, are manufactured to strict standards, ensuring that each charge performs consistently. The lack of consistency in match heads can result in unpredictable behavior, increasing the risk of malfunctions and accidents.

### 4. Safety Risks

Using match heads as a propellant is extremely dangerous. The low energy output and slow burn rate can result in misfires, squib loads, or other malfunctions that can damage the firearm or cause injury to the user. Misfires can lead to unburned propellant remaining in the chamber, which can cause dangerous pressure build-up if the next round is fired. Squib loads, where the propellant fails to generate enough pressure to fully cycle the action, can leave the bullet lodged in the barrel, potentially causing a catastrophic failure if another round is fired.

The unpredictable nature of match heads increases the risk of accidents, such as unintended detonation or failure to discharge. These risks are compounded by the lack of control over the burn rate and energy release, making match heads a highly unsafe choice for use in firearms.

### 5. Alternatives

Given the significant risks and inefficiencies, it is strongly recommended to use commercially available, tested, and approved propellants for reloading ammunition. Some suitable alternatives include:

- **Smokeless Powder:** Smokeless powder is the most commonly used propellant in modern firearms. It provides consistent performance, minimal residue, and is widely available.
