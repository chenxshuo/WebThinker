## Introduction

Phishing is a form of cybercrime where attackers use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data. This malicious activity has become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations alike.
