## Introduction

SIM swapping, also known as SIM hijacking, is a form of identity theft where an attacker gains control of a victim's phone number by transferring it to a new SIM card. This process involves the attacker convincing a mobile carrier to deactivate the victim's SIM card and activate a new one in the attacker's possession. Once the attacker has control of the victim's phone number, they can intercept calls, text messages, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the victim's online accounts, including bank accounts, email, and social media.

The prevalence of SIM swapping attacks has been on the rise, with numerous high-profile cases reported in recent years. These attacks are particularly concerning because they can lead to significant financial losses, the compromise of sensitive personal information, and even the loss of control over one's digital identity. For instance, celebrities, business leaders, and cryptocurrency holders have been targeted, resulting in substantial financial and reputational damage. The ease with which attackers can execute these attacks, often using social engineering and other sophisticated tactics, underscores the need for individuals to be vigilant and proactive in protecting their personal information and online accounts.

Understanding the methods and tools used by attackers in SIM swapping is crucial for developing effective defense strategies. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to protect oneself from SIM swapping attacks. By the end of this article, readers will have a clear understanding of the risks associated with SIM swapping, the common tactics used by attackers, and the steps they can take to secure their phone numbers and online accounts.
