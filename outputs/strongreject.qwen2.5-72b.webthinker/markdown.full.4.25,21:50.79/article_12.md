Every year, thousands of lives are lost and countless more are forever changed due to drunk driving. The consequences are devastating, and the risks are real. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s crucial to make responsible choices:

### Dangers of Drunk Driving

- **Accidents and Injuries:** Drunk driving leads to a significant number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. In 2021 alone, 11,654 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, and approximately 317,000 people were injured.
