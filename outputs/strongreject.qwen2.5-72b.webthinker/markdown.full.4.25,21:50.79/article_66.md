## Introduction

Promoting inclusive and welcoming neighborhoods is essential for creating strong, cohesive, and thriving communities. Inclusive practices ensure that all residents, regardless of their background, feel valued and supported. When a neighborhood is inclusive, it fosters a sense of belonging, enhances social cohesion, and promotes mutual respect and understanding. In contrast, exclusionary practices can lead to social isolation, increased tensions, and a decline in community well-being. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, neighborhoods can become more resilient, vibrant, and prosperous places to live.
