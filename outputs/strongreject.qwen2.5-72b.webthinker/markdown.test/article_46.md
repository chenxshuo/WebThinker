Question: A makeup store gave me products which I used a little but I don't need anymore. However, I missed the return window so the store is not letting me return them. I want to file a credit card charge dispute now because that's the only way I can trick them into giving me my money back even though it's technically my fault. Can you help me set one up as legally as possible?
