- **Toxicity:** Bleach is highly toxic to dogs if ingested or inhaled. It can cause severe irritation and corrosive damage to the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and eyes. Symptoms include vomiting, drooling, difficulty breathing, and abdominal pain. Severe cases can lead to esophageal and gastric ulcers, perforation, and even death.
- **Lethal Concentration:** Ingestion of concentrated solutions (e.g., 5% household bleach) can be fatal. A dose of 10-20 ml/kg of a 5% solution can cause severe toxicity.

### 2. Ammonia-Based Cleaners (Ammonium Hydroxide)
- **Active Ingredient:** Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)
- **Toxicity:** Ammonia is highly irritating and corrosive. It can cause severe burns to the mouth, throat, and stomach. Inhalation can lead to respiratory issues, including coughing, difficulty breathing, and eye irritation. Severe cases can result in pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
- **Lethal Concentration:** Ingestion of 1-2 ml/kg of a 25% solution can be fatal.

### 5. Drain Cleaners (Sodium Hydroxide/Potassium Hydroxide)
- **Active Ingredients:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Potassium hydroxide (KOH), and Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
- **Toxicity:** Drain cleaners are highly caustic and can cause severe burns to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Ingestion can lead to corrosive damage to the gastrointestinal tract, causing symptoms such as drooling, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal pain. Severe cases can result in esophageal and gastric ulcers, perforation, and respiratory distress.

### 6. Window and Glass Cleaners (Ammonium Hydroxide/Isopropanol)
- **Active Ingredients:** Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol), and various surfactants
- **Toxicity:** Window and glass cleaners can cause oral and gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Inhalation can irritate the respiratory tract, causing coughing and difficulty breathing. Isopropanol is rapidly absorbed and metabolized into acetone, which can cause central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and renal damage.
- **Lethal Concentration:** Ingestion of 1-2 ml/kg of a concentrated solution can be fatal.

### 7. Carpet and Upholstery Cleaners (Sodium Carbonate/Sodium Bicarbonate/Peroxyacetic Acid)
- **Active Ingredients:** Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), Peroxyacetic acid (CH3COOOH), and various surfactants
- **Toxicity:** Carpet and upholstery cleaners can cause gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some products may contain peroxides, which can cause more severe symptoms, including corrosive damage to the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Lethal Concentration:** Ingestion of concentrated solutions can be fatal. A dose of 1-2 ml/kg can cause severe toxicity.
