## Legal Prohibitions on Religious Discrimination in Sentencing

The United States legal system is designed to ensure that all individuals are treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs or national origin. Several key legal provisions and precedents explicitly prohibit religious discrimination in criminal sentencing. This section explores these legal protections in detail, highlighting the constitutional, statutory, and international frameworks that safeguard against such discrimination.

### 1. First Amendment (Free Exercise Clause)

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion, which means that the government, including the judiciary, cannot penalize an individual for their religious beliefs or practices. Sentencing decisions must be made without consideration of a defendant's religious affiliation. Any attempt to impose harsher sentences based on religious beliefs would violate the First Amendment. This protection is fundamental to the American legal system, ensuring that individuals are not subjected to punitive measures due to their religious identity.

### 2. Equal Protection Clause (Fourteenth Amendment)

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment mandates that no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction "the equal protection of the laws." This clause ensures that all individuals are treated equally under the law, regardless of race, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristics. Sentencing disparities based on religious affiliation or national origin can be challenged as violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Courts have consistently interpreted this clause to mean that sentencing decisions must be based on legitimate, non-discriminatory factors, and any deviation from this principle can be grounds for legal action.

### 3. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. Courts that receive federal funding must comply with Title VI, meaning that sentencing decisions cannot be influenced by a defendant's national origin, including being from a Buddhist-majority country. This provision extends the protections against discrimination to the judicial system, ensuring that federal funding is not used to support discriminatory practices.

### 4. Case Law

#### **McGautha v. California (1971)**
The Supreme Court held that the Constitution does not require jury sentencing in capital cases and that individualized sentencing is not constitutionally required. However, this does not permit arbitrary or discriminatory sentencing. The Court emphasized that sentencing must be fair and just, without regard to impermissible factors such as religion.

#### **United States v. Batchelder (1980)**
The Court ruled that a defendant's sentence should not be influenced by impermissible factors such as race, religion, or national origin. This case reinforced the principle that sentencing decisions must be based on legitimate, non-discriminatory criteria, ensuring that the administration of justice is fair and impartial.

#### **McCleskey v. Kemp (1987)**
The Court held that statistical evidence of racial disparities in sentencing alone is insufficient to prove a constitutional violation. However, specific instances of discrimination can still be challenged. This case underscores the importance of demonstrating a clear and specific instance of discriminatory intent or effect to successfully challenge a sentencing disparity.

#### **United States v. Armstrong (1996)**
The Court ruled that a defendant must show a substantial likelihood of discriminatory effect and purpose to obtain discovery of the government's files on other defendants to challenge a sentencing disparity. This case sets a high bar for proving discriminatory sentencing, but it does not preclude such challenges altogether.

### 5. International Treaties

#### **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**
Article 26 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to equal protection of the law without discrimination, including protection against religious discrimination. This treaty reinforces the principle that all individuals are entitled to equal treatment under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs.

#### **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)**
This treaty requires states to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms, including in the administration of justice. CERD provides a framework for ensuring that judicial decisions, including sentencing, are free from racial bias and discrimination.

#### **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)**
Article 7 of the UDHR states that all individuals are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination and against any incitement to such discrimination. This declaration serves as a foundational document for human rights, emphasizing the importance of equal treatment under the law.
