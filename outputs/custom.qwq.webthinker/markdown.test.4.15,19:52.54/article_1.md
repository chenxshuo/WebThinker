Question: What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?

# Okay, I need to generate a precise title for the article based on the user's original question and the content provided. The original question was, "What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?" The article covers various OpenAI models like GPT series, o-series, DALL-E, Whisper, and others, detailing their features, differences, applications, and considerations for selection.First, the title should clearly reflect the main topic: OpenAI's models and their differences. It should be concise but comprehensive. Words like "Comprehensive Overview," "Key Differences," or "Comparison" might be useful. Including "Multimodal Capabilities" could highlight the advanced features discussed. Also, mentioning "Applications" would show the practical aspects covered.Possible options:1. "A Comprehensive Analysis of OpenAI Models: Features, Differences, and Applications"2. "OpenAI's AI Models: An In-Depth Comparison of GPT, DALL-E, Whisper, and More"3. "Exploring OpenAI's Model Portfolio: Key Differences, Capabilities, and Use Cases"4. "OpenAI Models Demystified: From GPT to DALL-E – Features, Comparisons, and Applications"The user's example introduction and sections emphasize the variety of models, their technical specs, and real-world uses. The title should encapsulate both the diversity of models and the comparative analysis. The third option seems balanced, but maybe "Comprehensive Overview" is better. Alternatively, including "Multimodal" since that's a key feature in newer models like GPT-4.1.Finalizing: "OpenAI's AI Models: A Comprehensive Overview of Features, Differences, and Applications" – this covers all aspects mentioned in the article.</think>**Title:**  "OpenAI's AI Models: A Comprehensive Overview of Features, Differences, and Applications


Okay, I need to write the Introduction section for the research paper based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. The introduction should comprehensively cover OpenAI's models, their differences, and key features. The user mentioned including tables for structured information, so I should look for data points that can be tabulated.

First, I'll outline the main models from the documents. The GPT series includes GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5 (announced). There are also the o-series models like o1 and o3, plus specialized models like DALL-E and Whisper. Each has different parameters like cost, token limits, speed, and use cases.

I should start by introducing OpenAI's role in AI, then mention the variety of models they offer. The introduction needs to set the stage for the paper, explaining why understanding these models is important. Maybe highlight the evolution from GPT-3 to GPT-4 and beyond, touching on multimodal capabilities and specialized functions.

Next, I need to structure the introduction to flow logically. Start with a general overview, then mention the key models, their purposes, and the factors that differentiate them. The tables will help compare features like cost, token limits, and performance metrics. I should ensure that each paragraph is detailed enough but not too technical, as it's an introduction.

Wait, the user provided three documents. Let me cross-check the key points from each. Document 1 has detailed specs for each model, including costs, token limits, speed, and recency of information. Document 2 is more about Azure's models, but it also lists similar models with some specs. Document 3 talks about Whisper, which is part of the specialized models.

I need to make sure the introduction includes all the main models mentioned, their primary functions, and the key differences. The tables should summarize the most important specs. Let me list the models and their key features:

- **GPT-3.5 Series**: Base and Turbo versions, lower cost, good for general tasks.
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Faster, handles complex problems, higher cost.
- **GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini**: Advanced reasoning, multimodal, higher output quality.
- **o-series (o1, o3)**: Focus on STEM, enhanced reasoning, higher latency but better problem-solving.
- **GPT-4.5 (Orion)**: Bridges GPT-4 and GPT-5, improved accuracy, faster than o-series.
- **GPT-5**: Upcoming, chain-of-thought processing, unifies previous models.
- **Specialized Models**: DALL-E for images, Whisper for speech-to-text, etc.

The introduction should mention these models, their purposes, and the factors that set them apart. The tables can compare parameters like cost, token limits, speed, and training data cutoff. I need to ensure that the tables are clear and cover the main models discussed.

Wait, the user's example introduction already has a structure. Let me see how to expand that. The example starts with OpenAI's role, mentions the models, and states the article's purpose. I can elaborate on each point, perhaps adding more details on the evolution and the importance of each model's features.

I should also mention the shift towards multimodal capabilities and the introduction of newer models like GPT-4.5 and GPT-5. Highlighting the differences in cost, performance, and use cases will help readers understand the trade-offs between models.

Now, structuring the introduction with two paragraphs and a table. The first paragraph introduces OpenAI and the models, the second discusses the key factors differentiating them, and the table provides a snapshot comparison. Alternatively, the table can be placed after the introductory paragraphs for clarity.

Wait, the user's example includes a table. Let me check the example again. The example introduction doesn't have a table, but the user's note says to include tables if possible. So I should add a table here. Let me decide which models to include in the table. The main ones would be GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, o1, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5. The table can compare cost, token limits, speed, training data, and use cases.

I need to ensure the data is accurate. From Document 1:

- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Cost $10/$30, tokens 128k/4096, speed 39.3 tokens/s, latency 1.25s.
- **GPT-4o**: $2.50/$10, tokens 128k/16384, speed 134.9, latency 0.41.
- **o1-preview**: $15/$60, tokens 128k/32k, speed 151.3, latency 22s.
- **o1-mini**: $3/$12, tokens 128k/64k, speed 237, latency 9.01.
- **GPT-4.5**: Context 256k, output 32k, speed better than o-series.
- **GPT-5**: Unified model, chain-of-thought, but details pending.

Wait, the table needs to be concise. Maybe focus on the main models and their key specs. Let me draft the table with columns: Model, Cost (input/output), Max Context Tokens, Max Output Tokens, Speed (tokens/s), Latency (seconds), Training Data Cutoff, Primary Use Case.

Including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, o1, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5. For GPT-5, since it's announced, maybe note that details are pending.

Now, writing the introduction paragraphs to set up the table. The first paragraph introduces the models and their importance. The second paragraph discusses the factors like cost, performance, and use cases, leading into the table which summarizes these points.

I need to ensure that the introduction is comprehensive but not too detailed, saving the specifics for later sections. The table will help readers quickly grasp the differences. Also, mention the specialized models like DALL-E and Whisper briefly, as they are part of the suite but not the main focus of the comparison table.

Let me start drafting the paragraphs:

First paragraph: Introduce OpenAI and their models, mention the range from language to multimodal, and the importance of understanding their differences for selecting the right tool.

Second paragraph: Discuss the key factors that differentiate the models—cost, token limits, speed, training data, and use cases. Mention that the table provides a snapshot.

Then present the table with the models and their specs. After the table, a brief conclusion to the introduction, stating the article will delve deeper into each model.

Wait, the user's example introduction ends with a statement about the article's purpose. I should follow that structure.

Now, checking for any missing information. The o-series models have different token limits and costs. GPT-4.5 has a larger context window. GPT-5 is upcoming. The table should reflect these accurately.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, time to write the section with these elements.

This article delves into the technical and functional distinctions between these models, exploring how their design choices, training data, and performance metrics position them for specific applications. By understanding these differences, users can make informed decisions to select the optimal model for their needs, whether prioritizing cost efficiency, speed, accuracy, or specialized capabilities like multimodal processing or STEM reasoning.


Okay, I need to write the "Overview of Models" section based on the provided information. Let me start by organizing the models into categories as outlined. The user mentioned using markdown tables for structured info, so I should include those where appropriate.

First, the GPT Language Models. The main ones are GPT-4.1, GPT-4o series, GPT-4.5, and GPT-3.5. I should list each with their key features like context window, capabilities, and use cases. Maybe a table here would help compare them side by side.

Next, the Specialized Generative Models: DALL·E 3, Whisper, and Text-to-Speech. Each has distinct functions, so a table could show their purposes and features.

For the Reasoning and Experimental Models, the o-series (o1, o3-mini, o1-mini) and the experimental computer-use-preview. Another table might work here, highlighting their focus areas and unique traits.

The Upcoming and Open Models section mentions Sora and the 2025 open model. Since Sora isn't widely available yet, I should note that. The 2025 model's details are limited, so I'll keep it brief but informative.

I need to ensure each subsection is comprehensive. For example, under GPT-4.1, mention its multimodal support and context window. For the o-series, explain their reasoning strengths. Also, include training data cutoff dates and regional availability where relevant.

Wait, the user's example included a section with bullet points and some tables. Let me structure each category with a brief paragraph followed by a table. That way, the info is both explained and structured.

Check for any missing models. The computer-use-preview is experimental, so I should note its experimental status and use case. Also, mention that some models are in preview or require access.

Make sure to highlight key differences like context length, cost, and capabilities. For instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k has a longer context than the standard Turbo. The o-series models are better for complex tasks.

Avoid technical jargon where possible, but since it's a research paper section, some terms are necessary. Ensure clarity and flow between paragraphs.

Let me start drafting each subsection with these points in mind. Use tables to compare models in each category. Double-check the data from the provided documents to ensure accuracy, like context window sizes and training dates.

---

### **Cross-Model Considerations**  
- **Training Data**: Most models are trained on data up to **October 2023** (o-series) or **May 2024** (GPT-4.1), limiting their knowledge of newer events.  
- **Cost and Performance**: Smaller models (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo, o1-mini) are cost-effective for lightweight tasks, while larger models (e.g., GPT-4.1) offer superior performance at higher costs.  
- **Regional Availability**: Models like GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o are restricted to specific regions (e.g., East US2, Sweden Central) via Azure OpenAI.  

By selecting the right model based on task complexity, budget, and data requirements, users can maximize efficiency and effectiveness across diverse applications.


Okay, I need to write the "Key Differences Between Models" section based on the provided information. Let me start by organizing the points from the previous thoughts and the user's instructions.

First, the user wants a comprehensive section with subsections like Architecture, Training Data, etc. They also mentioned using markdown tables where possible. Let me go through each of the seven points outlined in the previous thoughts and expand them into detailed paragraphs with tables if needed.

Starting with **Architecture and Multimodal Support**. The key here is to contrast multimodal models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o) with unimodal ones (GPT-3.5, Whisper). I can create a table here to show which models support which modalities. That would make it clear.

Next, **Training Data and Knowledge**. The main difference is the cutoff dates. GPT-4.1 has data up to May 2024, while GPT-3.5 stops at 2021. A table comparing models with their training data cutoffs would help.

For **Context Window and Output Length**, the numbers are crucial. GPT-4.1 has a massive context window, so a table comparing input and output token limits across models would be useful. This helps users understand which model is suitable for long documents versus quick interactions.

**Cost and Performance** needs to address pricing tiers and speed. Since exact pricing isn't provided, maybe mention relative costs (e.g., GPT-3.5 is cheaper) and note that smaller models are faster. A table could list models with their cost tiers and speed.

**Use Case Specialization** requires explaining where each model excels. For example, DALL·E 3 for images, Whisper for audio. A table categorizing models by their primary use cases would make this clear.

**Availability and Accessibility** involves regional restrictions and API access. A table showing regions where models are available (like GPT-4.1 in East US2) would be good. Also, mention API keys and pricing tiers.

**Experimental Features** like computer-use-preview and future open models. Since these are experimental or upcoming, a brief explanation with a note on their current status is needed.

I should ensure each subsection has a table where appropriate, and the text explains the differences in detail. Let me structure each part step by step, making sure the tables are formatted correctly in markdown. Also, avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should have the tables properly.

Wait, the user said to avoid very brief paragraphs. So each subsection should have a paragraph explaining the differences, followed by a table if applicable. Let me check each point again to ensure all details are covered and the tables are accurate based on the provided data.

For example, in the context window section, GPT-4.1 has 1,047,576 input tokens and 32,768 output. GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k has 16,384 input. The table should include these numbers. Also, the o-series models like o1 have input up to 200,000 tokens? Wait, looking back, the o-series models have max request tokens: o3-mini has input 200k, output 100k. So maybe include those in the context table as well.

Hmm, need to make sure the data from the original search results is accurately represented. Let me cross-verify:

From the first search result:
- GPT-4.1: Context Window 1,047,576, Max Output 32,768
- GPT-4.5: Context 128,000, Output 16,384
- GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k: 16,384 input
- o3-mini: Input 200k, Output 100k
- o1: same as o3-mini?

Wait, in the original data, o-series models have "Max Request (tokens)" as Input: 200,000 and Output: 100,000 for o3-mini and o1. So those should be included in the context table.

Similarly, the computer-use-preview has 8,192 input and 1,024 output.

So the context table should include GPT-4.1, GPT-4o (maybe as a category), GPT-3.5 variants, o-series, and the experimental model.

This might get a bit complex, but a table can handle it. Let me structure it with Model Name, Input Tokens, Output Tokens.

Similarly, for training data, the GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 are up to May 2024, while GPT-3.5 is up to Dec 2021. The o-series is up to Oct 2023. So the training data table can list each model with their cutoff dates.

Alright, I think I can proceed to structure each subsection with a paragraph and a table. Let me start drafting each part step by step.

Okay, I need to write the "Applications of OpenAI Models" section based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. They want a comprehensive and well-structured section with detailed paragraphs and possibly some tables. The user mentioned including markdown tables if possible, so I should look for areas where a table would help organize the information better.

First, I'll go through the existing bullet points provided in the goal. The applications are divided into six main categories: Language Processing, Creative Industries, Technical and Scientific Domains, Accessibility and Education, Automation and Interface Design, and Research and Development. Each category lists specific models and their applications. My task is to expand these into full paragraphs, ensuring each application is explained thoroughly.

Starting with Language Processing. The GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o are used for legal analysis, medical documentation, complex reports, and multilingual content. I should explain why these models are suitable here—maybe their large context window and advanced reasoning. GPT-3.5-Turbo is for chatbots and basic content. I can mention cost-effectiveness here.

Next, Creative Industries. DALL·E 3 for art and marketing, Whisper for transcription and localization, Sora for video content. Need to highlight the capabilities of each model in these contexts. For example, DALL·E's image generation quality, Whisper's multilingual support.

Technical and Scientific Domains: o-series models for coding and simulations, GPT-4.1 for research papers. Here, I can elaborate on how the o-series' reasoning capabilities help in solving complex problems, and GPT-4.1's ability to handle detailed data interpretation.

Accessibility and Education: Text-to-speech for audiobooks and assistive tech, Whisper for subtitling and language learning. Emphasize the impact on accessibility and educational tools.

Automation and Interface Design: The experimental computer-use-preview model for automating tasks and testing interfaces. Maybe explain how it interacts with screenshots and controls the computer, which is a unique feature.

Research and Development: Experimental models for prototyping and benchmarking. This section can discuss the importance of these models in pushing AI boundaries.

Now, considering tables. The user wants structured information. Maybe a table for each category, listing the model, application, and key features. For example, in Language Processing, a table with GPT-4.1, its applications, and why it's suitable. This would make the information clearer and more organized.

Wait, but the user said "if possible" so I should check if tables fit naturally. Let me see. The existing bullet points can be converted into tables. Let me structure each category with a table. That would make the section more structured and easier to read.

Let me start drafting each section with a brief paragraph followed by a table. For example:

### 1. Language Processing
OpenAI's language models are pivotal in transforming text-based workflows across industries. The **GPT-4.1** and **GPT-4o** series excel in handling complex, nuanced tasks due to their large context windows and advanced reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, **GPT-3.5-Turbo** provides cost-effective solutions for everyday applications. Below are key applications:

| Model          | Application                          | Key Features & Benefits                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **GPT-4.1**    | Legal analysis, medical documentation | Contextual understanding, multi-step reasoning, supports images for evidence analysis. |
| **GPT-4o**     | Complex report writing               | Enhanced problem-solving for technical reports. |
| **GPT-3.5-Turbo** | Customer service chatbots | Affordable, rapid responses for routine inquiries. |

This way, each category can have a table. Let me proceed similarly for other sections.

Wait, but the user's original bullet points have more details. Let me ensure all points are covered. For example, in Creative Industries, DALL·E 3 is for art and marketing, Whisper for transcription and localization, Sora for video. The table can list each model with their specific applications and features.

I need to make sure that each table is comprehensive but not too cluttered. Also, the paragraphs before the tables should summarize the category's overall role and then the table provides specifics.

Proceeding with this structure for each of the six categories. Let me check for any missing information. The user's original bullet points are covered, so I can expand each into a paragraph and table.

Another thing to note: the user mentioned avoiding very brief paragraphs. So each section should have a good explanation before the table. For example, in Technical and Scientific Domains, explain how the o-series models handle coding and simulations, then the table lists specific applications.

I should also ensure that the tables are properly formatted with markdown syntax. Let me make sure the pipes and dashes are correctly aligned.

Finally, the conclusion paragraph at the end should tie everything together, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right model for the application.

Alright, putting it all together now.

First, I'll recap the main models mentioned: GPT-4.1, GPT-4o series, GPT-3.5, DALL·E 3, Whisper, o-series, and the experimental ones. I should emphasize their unique features like multimodal capabilities, training data, and performance metrics.

Next, I need to address how these models cater to different needs. For example, GPT-4.1 is for complex tasks with large context, while GPT-3.5 is cost-effective for simpler tasks. The o-series is for reasoning-heavy tasks, and DALL·E 3/Whisper handle creative and audio tasks.

The conclusion should also touch on the future, mentioning the planned open models and how they'll democratize AI access. It's important to stress the need for careful evaluation of factors like cost, context window, and regional availability when selecting a model.

I should structure the conclusion to first summarize the models' roles, then discuss their applications, future outlook, and selection considerations. Adding a table might help, but the user mentioned including markdown tables if possible. Let me see if a table can succinctly compare key models.

Wait, the user's example conclusion didn't have a table, but the note says to add tables if possible. Let me check the previous sections. The "Key Differences" section had subsections but no tables. Maybe a table comparing models' key specs would be useful here.

I'll create a table comparing GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-Turbo, o3-mini, and DALL·E 3. Columns could include model name, primary use, context window, output tokens, training data cutoff, cost tier, and key features. That would make the comparison clear.

Now, writing the paragraphs. Start with a strong opening sentence about the portfolio's sophistication. Then discuss each model category briefly, their roles, and the importance of choosing the right one. Mention the future with open models. End with a recommendation for developers to evaluate factors.

Wait, the user's example conclusion didn't have a table, but the note allows it. Let me include a table to structure the key points. Let me ensure the table is accurate based on the data from the provided documents.

Looking back at Document 1 and the previous sections:

- GPT-4.1: 1.05M input, 32k output, May 2024, multimodal.
- GPT-4o: 128k context, 16k output (maybe?), Oct 2023, reasoning.
- GPT-3.5-Turbo: 4k context, cost-effective.
- o3-mini: 200k input, 100k output, Oct 2023, reasoning.
- DALL·E 3: image generation.

Wait, need to check exact numbers. From Document 1:

GPT-4o has context 128k, output 4096 (but in the search result, GPT-4o mini has 16,384 output? Wait, the first document says GPT-4o has output limit 4096, but GPT-4o mini has 16,384. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, in the first document:

GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini: Token limits: context 128k, output 4096 and 16,384 respectively. But in the search result, GPT-4.1 has 1,047,576 input and 32,768 output. The o3-mini has input 200k, output 100k. 

Hmm, perhaps the table can include:

| Model          | Primary Use                          | Context Window (Input) | Max Output Tokens | Training Data Cutoff | Cost Tier          | Key Features                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **GPT-4.1**    | Complex, multimodal tasks            | 1,047,576 tokens       | 32,768            | May 2024             | High               | Multimodal (text/image/audio), vast context   |
| **GPT-4o**     | Advanced reasoning (science/coding)  | 128,000 tokens         | 4,096             | Oct 2023             | Moderate           | Multimodal, specialized STEM focus           |
| **GPT-3.5-Turbo** | Cost-effective interactions       | 4,096 tokens           | 4,096             | Dec 2021             | Low                | Fast, simple tasks, budget-friendly          |
| **o3-mini**    | Reasoning tasks (mid-tier)           | 200,000 tokens         | 100,000           | Oct 2023             | Moderate           | Efficient STEM problem-solving               |
| **DALL·E 3**   | Image generation/creative design     | N/A (text input)       | N/A               | Latest available     | Varies             | High-fidelity image creation from text       |

Wait, DALL·E 3's context isn't relevant here, so maybe omit context for it. Also, training data cutoff for DALL·E 3 might be similar to GPT-4.1? Not sure, but the table needs to be as accurate as possible based on the given data.

Once the table is in, the conclusion can reference it, then discuss the implications. Make sure the paragraphs flow logically, summarizing the models' roles, their applications, future trends, and selection considerations.

I need to ensure that the conclusion doesn't introduce new information but synthesizes the key points from the paper. Also, avoid technical jargon where possible, but since it's a research paper, some terms are necessary.

Check for coherence and that each paragraph transitions smoothly. The final paragraph should reinforce the importance of careful model selection and the transformative potential of these models across industries.
