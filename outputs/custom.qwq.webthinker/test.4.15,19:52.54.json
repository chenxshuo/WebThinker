        "Question": "What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?",
        "prompt": "<|im_start|>user\nYou are a research assistant with the ability to perform web searches to write a scientific research article. You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|>search results<|end_search_result|>.\n\n- To write a section of the research article: write <|begin_write_section|>section name\ncontents to write<|end_write_section|>.\nThen, the system will completely write the section based on your request and current gathered information.\n\n- To check the current article: write <|begin_check_article|>system returns outline of all current written contents<|end_check_article|>.\n\n- To edit the article: write <|begin_edit_article|>your detailed edit goal and instruction<|end_edit_article|>.\nThen, the system will edit the article based on your goal and instruction and current gathered information.\n\nYour task is to research and write a scientific article about:\nWhat are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\n\nHere is a research plan to guide your investigation:\nOkay, the user wants a detailed plan to search the web for information on OpenAI's models and their differences. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the best way to gather all the necessary information step by step. \n\nStarting with the basics, the first step should be to visit OpenAI's official website. That's the most reliable source for their models. They probably list all their models there with descriptions. But maybe there are more models not highlighted, so I should check their blog and research sections too.\n\nNext, I should look for recent articles or press releases. OpenAI often announces new models, so tech news sites like TechCrunch or The Verge might have updates. Also, checking Wikipedia could be useful since it might have a comprehensive list, but I need to cross-verify with official sources.\n\nThen, technical documentation is key. The OpenAI API docs would detail each model's capabilities, parameters, and use cases. Comparing the models there would show differences in features like language understanding, code generation, or performance metrics.\n\nFor community discussions, forums like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or specialized AI communities on platforms like Discord might have user experiences and comparisons. This could highlight real-world differences in performance or applications.\n\nAcademic papers from OpenAI's publications would provide in-depth technical details. ArXiv or their official research page might have papers on model architectures, training data, and innovations between versions.\n\nThird-party analyses and benchmarks are important too. Sites like Distil.pub or research papers comparing models like GPT-3 vs. GPT-3.5 could offer insights into performance metrics, efficiency, and specific use cases.\n\nSocial media and Twitter threads from AI experts might have quick summaries or comparisons. Following OpenAI's official accounts or prominent researchers could yield recent updates or discussions on model differences.\n\nLastly, checking developer forums like Stack Overflow for troubleshooting or implementation differences between models. This might reveal practical aspects like API usage, limitations, or specific scenarios where one model outperforms another.\n\nWait, did I miss any sources? Maybe GitHub repositories for any open-source models? But OpenAI's models aren't fully open-source, except maybe older ones like GPT-2. Still, including that could be a step. Hmm, but the user specified no more than 8 steps. Let me see. The steps I have cover official sources, news, docs, forums, papers, third-party analyses, social media, and developer forums. That's eight. Maybe GitHub can be part of the official site check or community discussions. I think the current steps are comprehensive enough. Let me structure them clearly.\n</think>\n\n(1) Visit OpenAI's official website to identify all publicly listed models (e.g., GPT series, DALL·E, Whisper, etc.) and their descriptions.  \n(2) Review OpenAI's blog and press releases for announcements about new models, updates, or deprecated versions.  \n(3) Explore OpenAI's technical documentation (API docs, research papers) to compare parameters, capabilities, and use cases across models.  \n(4) Search tech news platforms (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge) for articles analyzing model differences and real-world applications.  \n(5) Check Wikipedia and AI-focused wikis for structured comparisons of model generations (e.g., GPT-2 vs. GPT-3 vs. GPT-4) and their advancements.  \n(6) Investigate community forums (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow) for user discussions on model performance, limitations, and practical distinctions.  \n(7) Analyze third-party benchmarks and analyses (e.g., Distil.pub, research papers) comparing model accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency.  \n(8) Review social media (e.g., Twitter/X threads by AI experts) for concise summaries or direct quotes from OpenAI developers about model distinctions.\n\nPlease follow the research plan step by step:\n1. Use web searches to gather detailed information for each point\n2. After each search, analyze the results and determine what additional information is needed\n3. When you have sufficient information for a section, request to write that section\n4. Continue this process until the full article is complete\n5. Check the current article and edit sections as needed to improve clarity and completeness\n\nExample:\n<|begin_search_query|>first search query<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>Summary of information from searched web pages<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on these results, I understand X, but still need to investigate Y...\n\n<|begin_search_query|>follow-up search query focusing on Y<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>Summary of information from searched web pages<|end_search_result|>\n\nNow I have enough information to write the first section...\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Introduction\nThis section should introduce ... <|end_write_section|>\n\nI have written the introduction.

        "Output": "Okay, let's start by following the research plan. First, I need to visit OpenAI's official website to list all their models. So I'll do a search for their main page.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>OpenAI official website models list<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>The following information is compiled from relevant web pages detailing OpenAI's models, focusing on the **officially listed models** and their key features:\n\n---\n\n### **Core OpenAI Models (from official and affiliated sources):**\n1. **GPT Series (Language Models):**\n   - **GPT-4.1**  \n     - Latest iteration with improved reasoning and multimodal capabilities (accepts text and images).  \n     - Context window: 1,047,576 tokens (max output 32,768 tokens).  \n     - Training data cutoff: May 2024.  \n     - Available via Azure (East US2, Sweden Central).  \n\n   - **GPT-4o Series**  \n     - Includes **GPT-4o**, **GPT-4o Mini**, and **GPT-4o Audio**.  \n     - Designed for advanced reasoning and problem-solving.  \n     - Supports image and text inputs (GPT-4o Audio adds real-time audio interaction).  \n     - Training data cutoff: October 2023.  \n\n   - **GPT-4.5 (Preview)**  \n     - Excels in diverse text/image tasks but replaced by GPT-4.1 in some regions.  \n     - Context window: 128,000 tokens.  \n\n   - **GPT-3.5 Series**  \n     - Includes **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (cost-effective) and **GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k** (longer context).  \n     - Base GPT-3.5 for general text and code generation.  \n\n2. **Specialized Models:**  \n   - **DALL·E 3**  \n     - Text-to-image generation with advanced creativity and precision.  \n\n   - **Whisper**  \n     - Speech-to-text and translation (preview).  \n\n   - **Text-to-Speech (Preview)**  \n     - Converts text to natural-sounding speech.  \n\n   - **Sora**  \n     - Text-to-video model (announced but not yet widely accessible).  \n\n3. **Reasoning Models (o-series):**  \n   - **o3-mini**, **o1**, and **o1-mini**  \n     - Optimized for complex tasks (e.g., coding, science).  \n     - Higher focus and problem-solving capability than prior models.  \n\n4. **Experimental Models:**  \n   - **computer-use-preview**  \n     - Experimental model for interacting with computer interfaces (mouse/keyboard control via screenshots).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes from Official Documentation References:**\n- **Access via Azure OpenAI Service** (Web Page 2):  \n  - Regional availability varies (e.g., GPT-4.1 in East US2, Sweden Central).  \n  - Pricing tiers: **Standard, Provisioned, and Batch** for different workloads.  \n\n- **API Access** (Web Pages 3, 6, 12):  \n  - Programmatic retrieval of models via `openai.models.list()` (Python) or cURL:  \n    ```bash\n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n    ```  \n\n- **Upcoming Releases** (Web Page 17):  \n  - OpenAI plans to release an \"open\" language model (similar to GPT-2) in 2025 with reasoning capabilities (o3-mini-like).  \n\n---\n\n### **Important Considerations:**\n- **Training Data Cutoff Dates**:  \n  - Most models are trained up to **October 2023** (GPT-4o/o-series) or **May 2024** (GPT-4.1).  \n- **Multimodal Support**:  \n  - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o-series support **text, images, and audio** (e.g., GPT-4o Audio).  \n- **Cost and Performance**:  \n  - Smaller models (e.g., o1-mini, GPT-3.5-Turbo) are cheaper and faster for lightweight tasks.  \n  - Larger models (e.g., GPT-4.1) offer superior performance but higher costs.  \n\n---\n\n### **Official Sources Mentioned:**\n- **Primary Links (inaccessible content but referenced):**  \n  - OpenAI API Docs: `platform.openai.com/docs/models` (lists models via API).  \n  - Azure OpenAI Service: `azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service`.  \n- **Community Tools:**  \n  - **LLM.datasette.io** (Web Page 7) provides aliases and configurations for OpenAI models.  \n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date list, users should **directly consult the OpenAI API documentation** or use the official Python library’s `list()` method.<|end_search_result|>\n\nAlright, now that I've got the list of models from the official sources, I need to delve deeper into their differences. Let's start by breaking down each model's features, capabilities, and use cases. \n\nFirst, the GPT series. From the search results, GPT-4.1 is the latest, with multimodal support and a huge context window. It's available in specific regions. Then there's the GPT-4o series, which includes variants like GPT-4o Mini and GPT-4o Audio. These are optimized for reasoning and can handle images and text. The GPT-4.5 is mentioned as a predecessor to GPT-4.1 but still in use in some areas. GPT-3.5 is the more economical option, with Turbo and Turbo-16k for different context lengths.\n\nNext, the specialized models like DALL·E 3 for images, Whisper for speech, and Sora for video. The reasoning models (o-series) like o3-mini and o1 have better problem-solving skills. The experimental computer-use-preview is interesting—it interacts with computer interfaces, which is a newer feature.\n\nNow, the user asked for differences. I should compare parameters like architecture, training data, capabilities, cost, and use cases. For example, GPT-4.1 has a larger context window than GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k (which is 16k vs. 128k?), wait no—the search result says GPT-4.5 has 128k and GPT-4.1 has 32k output. Wait, actually, the context window for GPT-4.1 is 1 million tokens input, but output max is 32k. The GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k has a 16k token context. So that's a key difference in handling long documents.\n\nAlso, training data cutoff dates matter—older models might not know things after their cutoff. Multimodal support is another big difference; GPT-4o can take images, while older GPT-3.5 can't. Cost-wise, smaller models are cheaper. \n\nI should structure the article sections: Introduction, Overview of Models, Detailed Breakdown by Category, Key Differences, Applications, and Conclusion. Let me start with the introduction.\n\nWait, before writing, maybe check if there's more info on the reasoning models. Let me do another search to confirm details on the o-series.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>OpenAI o-series models differences from GPT-4<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>\n\nHmm, the search result isn't showing here. Let me try again with a different query.\n\nWait, maybe the initial search already covered some of that. From the first search, the o-series includes o1 and o3-mini, which are part of the GPT-4o family. They are noted for advanced reasoning and problem-solving. The o-series models might have been trained specifically on tasks requiring logical steps, like math problems or coding. \n\nSince the first search mentioned that the upcoming open model in 2025 will be similar to o3-mini, perhaps the o-series focuses on enhanced reasoning compared to standard GPT-4. Need to clarify if they have different parameters or just tuned for certain tasks. Since the search results didn't give more details, maybe proceed with the info we have and note that they're optimized for reasoning tasks.\n\nMoving on, perhaps I should also look into Whisper and DALL·E 3 specifics. Let's do a search for their capabilities.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>OpenAI Whisper vs DALL-E 3 capabilities<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>\n\nAgain, no detailed results. Wait, in the first search, Whisper was described as speech-to-text and translation (preview), while DALL·E 3 is text-to-image. Their primary functions differ entirely: one handles audio, the other images. So their differences are clear in purpose. \n\nPerhaps the key differences between models are their primary function (language, image, audio), size, cost, and capabilities like context length and multimodality.\n\nNow, with the gathered info, let's start writing the introduction section.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Introduction\nOpenAI has developed a suite of advanced artificial intelligence models designed to address diverse computational and creative tasks. These models, ranging from foundational language processing to specialized applications like image generation and speech recognition, represent significant milestones in AI research.

The original question was, \"What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\" The article covers various OpenAI models like GPT series, o-series, DALL-E, Whisper, and others, detailing their features, differences, applications, and considerations for selection.First, the title should clearly reflect the main topic: OpenAI's models and their differences. It should be concise but comprehensive. Words like \"Comprehensive Overview,\" \"Key Differences,\" or \"Comparison\" might be useful. Including \"Multimodal Capabilities\" could highlight the advanced features discussed. Also, mentioning \"Applications\" would show the practical aspects covered.Possible options:1. \"A Comprehensive Analysis of OpenAI Models: Features, Differences, and Applications\"2. \"OpenAI's AI Models: An In-Depth Comparison of GPT, DALL-E, Whisper, and More\"3. \"Exploring OpenAI's Model Portfolio: Key Differences, Capabilities, and Use Cases\"4. \"OpenAI Models Demystified: From GPT to DALL-E – Features, Comparisons, and Applications\"The user's example introduction and sections emphasize the variety of models, their technical specs, and real-world uses.

The previous step was going to the official site to get that list. So the intent here is likely to gather an accurate and comprehensive list of all OpenAI models directly from the source. \n\nThe user probably wants to ensure they have the most up-to-date and correct information, which the official site provides. They might be looking for details like model names, release dates, capabilities, or technical specifications. Since they mentioned differences, they might need the list to compare features, performance, or use cases between models. \n\nAlso, considering the previous thoughts mentioned starting with the official site, the intent is foundational—getting the list first before diving into comparisons. The user might not just want a simple list but also any documentation or descriptions that OpenAI provides about each model to understand their distinctions. \n\nI should make sure the intent captures the need for an authoritative source, comprehensiveness, and the purpose of using this list to then analyze differences. Maybe they also want to avoid outdated models or ensure they include the latest releases. \n\nSo the detailed intent would be to retrieve an official, up-to-date list of all OpenAI models from their website to serve as the basis for comparing and contrasting their features, capabilities, and other characteristics as per the original question.\n</think>\n\n**Detailed Intent of the Latest Search Query:**  \nThe user's intent with the search query *\"OpenAI official website models list\"* is to **obtain an authoritative, up-to-date, and comprehensive list of all OpenAI models directly from the company's official source**. This list is intended to serve as the foundational data to address the original question: *\"What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\"*  \n\n### Key Objectives Behind the Search:\n1. **Accuracy and Authority**: The user seeks verified information from OpenAI’s official website to ensure the list includes the most current models (e.g., newly released versions like GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, or others) and excludes outdated or deprecated models.\n2. **Comprehensiveness**: They aim to identify **all** models, including:\n   - Core language models (e.g., GPT series: GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4).\n   - Specialized models (e.g., Codex for coding, DALL·E for images, Whisper for audio).\n   - Variants or optimized versions (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, GPT-4-110K, etc.).\n3. **Preparation for Comparison**: The list will be used to **compare models** based on factors like:\n   - Capabilities (e.g., text generation, coding, multi-modal tasks).\n   - Performance (e.g., context length, speed, cost).\n   - Use cases (e.g., fine-tuning, API access, research).\n   - Release dates and version updates.\n4. **Avoiding Bias or Incomplete Sources**: By referencing the official site, the user ensures they avoid third-party summaries that might omit details, mislabel models, or include outdated information.\n\n### Underlying Needs:\n- **Clarity on Model Hierarchy**: Understanding how models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 relate to each other and their specific features.\n- **Technical Specifications**: Details such as token limits, training data cutoff dates, or API availability.\n- **Context for Decision-Making**: If the user is selecting a model for a project, they need clear distinctions to choose the best fit.\n\nThis search is the first step in a process to systematically analyze and explain the differences between OpenAI’s models, ensuring the final answer is reliable and aligned with OpenAI’s official documentation.\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**\n***Web Page 1:***\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI Platform\",\n  \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\",\n  \"site_name\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Explore developer resources, tutorials, API docs, and dynamic examples to get the most out of <strong>OpenAI</strong>&#x27;s platform.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Mf-qwekKoldS8BbJzahdO91cSBLc-D7SrIpRyCc31_Q/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTVkYzdlNzk0/OTkzZjcwNzBlMDgw/YjIwZjhkNzA2ZmFk/ODY5YjBmYTExNDkz/OWVmZTMyNzNjNTY5/MGQxMjYyZi9wbGF0/Zm9ybS5vcGVuYWku/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"platform.openai.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 2:***\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Azure OpenAI Service models - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn\",\n  \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models\",\n  \"site_name\": \"learn.microsoft.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Learn about the different <strong>model</strong> capabilities that are available with Azure <strong>OpenAI</strong>.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/dKusAYBYTLeCBl16XSMYRZO-wCc_EyGpoH65Oj11tOU/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMmMzNjVjYjk4/NmJkODdmNTU4ZDU1/MGUwNjk0MWFmZWU0/NmYzZjVlYmZjZDIy/MWM4MGMwODc4MDhi/MDM5MmZkYy9sZWFy/bi5taWNyb3NvZnQu/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"learn.microsoft.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Azure OpenAI Service models - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn Skip to main content Skip to Ask Learn chat experience This browser is no longer supported.

It aims to develop \\\"safe and beneficial\\\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \\\"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\\\". [ 5 ] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom , [ 6 ] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models , the DALL-E series of text-to-image models , and a text-to-video model named Sora . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI . The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc . , [ 9 ] registered in Delaware , and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC. [ 10 ] Its stated mission is to ensure that AGI \\\"benefits all of humanity\\\". [ 11 ] Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity , having invested US$13 billion. [ 12 ] It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform , Microsoft Azure . [ 13 ] In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] History [ edit ] 2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings [ edit ] Former headquarters at the Pioneer Building in San Francisco In December 2015, OpenAI was founded by Sam Altman , Elon Musk , Ilya Sutskever , Greg Brockman , Trevor Blackwell , Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy , Durk Kingma, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba , with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co-chairs. A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman , Jessica Livingston , Peter Thiel , Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys , and YC Research . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.

To stream the response body, use .with_streaming_response instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call .read() , .text() , .json() , .iter_bytes() , .iter_text() , .iter_lines() or .parse() . In the async client, these are async methods. As such, .with_streaming_response methods return a different APIResponse object, and the async client returns an AsyncAPIResponse object. with client . chat . completions . with_streaming_response . create ( messages = [\\n        { \\\"role\\\" : \\\"user\\\" , \\\"content\\\" : \\\"Say this is a test\\\" ,\\n        }\\n    ], model = \\\"gpt-4o\\\" ,\\n) as response : print ( response . headers . get ( \\\"X-My-Header\\\" )) for line in response . iter_lines (): print ( line ) The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed. Making custom/undocumented requests This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API. If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used. Undocumented endpoints To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using client.get , client.post , and other\\nhttp verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request. import httpx response = client . post ( \\\"/foo\\\" , cast_to = httpx . Response , body = { \\\"my_param\\\" : True },\\n) print ( response . headers . get ( \\\"x-foo\\\" )) Undocumented request params If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the extra_query , extra_body , and extra_headers request\\noptions. Undocumented response properties To access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like response.unknown_prop . You\\ncan also get all the extra fields on the Pydantic model as a dict with response.model_extra . Configuring the HTTP client You can directly override the httpx client to customize it for your use case, including: Support for proxies Custom transports Additional advanced functionality import httpx from openai import OpenAI , DefaultHttpxClient client = OpenAI ( # Or use the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var base_url = \\\"http://my.test.server.example.com:8083/v1\\\" , http_client = DefaultHttpxClient ( proxy = \\\"http://my.test.proxy.example.com\\\" , transport = httpx . HTTPTransport ( local_address = \\\"0.0.0.0\\\" ),\\n    ),\\n) You can also customize the client on a per-request basis by using with_options() : client . with_options ( http_client = DefaultHttpxClient (...)) Managing HTTP resources By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is garbage collected . You can manually close the client using the .close() method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting. from openai import OpenAI with OpenAI () as client : # make requests here ... # HTTP client is now closed Microsoft Azure OpenAI To use this library with Azure OpenAI , use the AzureOpenAI class in\"\n}\n***Web Page 13:***\n{\n  \"id\": 13,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI's GPT models\",\n  \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gp\",\n  \"site_name\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Explore developer resources, tutorials, API docs, and dynamic examples to get the most out of <strong>OpenAI</strong>&#x27;s platform.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Mf-qwekKoldS8BbJzahdO91cSBLc-D7SrIpRyCc31_Q/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTVkYzdlNzk0/OTkzZjcwNzBlMDgw/YjIwZjhkNzA2ZmFk/ODY5YjBmYTExNDkz/OWVmZTMyNzNjNTY5/MGQxMjYyZi9wbGF0/Zm9ybS5vcGVuYWku/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"platform.openai.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 14:***\n{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"title\": \"Pricing\",\n  \"url\": \"https://openai.com/pricing\",\n  \"site_name\": \"openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Requests sent to fine-tuned <strong>models</strong> are billed at our usage rates.

Note While our SDK supports both the OpenAIResponsesModel and the OpenAIChatCompletionsModel shapes, we recommend using a single model shape for each workflow because the two shapes support a different set of features and tools. If your workflow requires mixing and matching model shapes, make sure that all the features you're using are available on both. from agents import Agent , Runner , AsyncOpenAI , OpenAIChatCompletionsModel import asyncio spanish_agent = Agent ( name = \\\"Spanish agent\\\" , instructions = \\\"You only speak Spanish.\\\" , model = \\\"o3-mini\\\" , # (1)! ) english_agent = Agent ( name = \\\"English agent\\\" , instructions = \\\"You only speak English\\\" , model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel ( # (2)! model = \\\"gpt-4o\\\" , openai_client = AsyncOpenAI () ), ) triage_agent = Agent ( name = \\\"Triage agent\\\" , instructions = \\\"Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.\\\" , handoffs = [ spanish_agent , english_agent ], model = \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo\\\" , ) async def main (): result = await Runner . run ( triage_agent , input = \\\"Hola, ¿cómo estás?\\\" ) print ( result . final_output ) Sets the name of an OpenAI model directly.

The form, which OpenAI is inviting “developers, researchers, and [members of] the broader community” to fill out, includes questions like, “What would you like to see in an open-weight model from OpenAI?” and “What open models have you used in the past?” “We’re excited to collaborate with developers, researchers, and the broader community to gather inputs and make this model as useful as possible,” OpenAI wrote on its website. “If you’re interested in joining a feedback session with the OpenAI team, please let us know [in the form] below.” OpenAI plans to host developer events to gather feedback and, in the future, demo prototypes of the model. The first developer event will take place in San Francisco within a few weeks, followed by sessions in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. we’re releasing a model this year that you can run on your own hardware https://t.co/0ji9oezNyr — Steven Heidel (@stevenheidel) March 31, 2025 OpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an “open” approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI’s strategy, these “open” competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization. It has proven to be a wildly successful strategy for some outfits. Meta, which has invested heavily in its Llama family of open AI models, said earlier in March that Llama had racked up over 1 billion downloads . Meanwhile, DeepSeek has quickly amassed a large worldwide user base and attracted the attention of domestic investors . In a recent Reddit Q&A , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he thinks OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. “[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy,” Altman said. “Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it’s also not our current highest priority […] We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years.” Altman expanded on OpenAI’s open model plans in a post on X on Monday afternoon , saying that OpenAI’s upcoming open model will have “reasoning” capabilities along the lines of OpenAI’s o3-mini. “[B]efore release, we will evaluate this model according [to] our preparedness framework, like we would for any other model,” Altman said. “[A]nd we will do extra work given that we know this model will be modified post-release […] [W]e’re excited to see what developers build and how large companies and governments use it where they prefer to run a model themselves.” Excerpts of a forthcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey published over the weekend allege that Altman misled OpenAI executives about model safety reviews prior to his brief ouster in November 2023.

                "Output": "Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants the list of OpenAI models from the official website to understand their differences. First, I'll look through the provided web pages to find relevant info.\n\nStarting with Web Page 2 from Microsoft Learn, it lists several models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o-series, and others. This seems detailed but mentions Azure, so maybe it's a subset. Web Page 7 from LLM.datasette.io also lists models like GPT-4o and o1, which aligns but might not be the official list.\n\nWeb Page 6 is the OpenAI API docs for listing models, but the content isn't accessible. Similarly, Web Page 1 and 13 are official links but can't be fetched. Web Page 16 from OpenAI Agents SDK mentions models like OpenAIChatCompletionsModel and OpenAIResponsesModel, pointing to GPT-4o and o3-mini.\n\nWeb Page 11 (Wikipedia) mentions GPT series, DALL-E, and Sora, which are key models but not the exhaustive list. Web Page 17 talks about an upcoming open model, but that's future.\n\nStack Overflow (Page 3) shows how to programmatically get the list via API, indicating the official method but not the actual list. The GitHub repo (Page 12) confirms the Python library's use but no model names.\n\nPutting it together, the most comprehensive list comes from Web Page 2 and 7, though they might include Azure-specific models. The official site's inaccessibility means relying on these secondary sources. Need to highlight core models like GPT-4, GPT-4o series, o-series, DALL-E, Whisper, and mention Azure variants. Also note that the official API is the definitive source but wasn't accessible here.\n\n**Final Information**  \nThe following information is compiled from relevant web pages detailing OpenAI's models, focusing on the **officially listed models** and their key features:\n\n---\n\n### **Core OpenAI Models (from official and affiliated sources):**\n1. **GPT Series (Language Models):**\n   - **GPT-4.1**  \n     - Latest iteration with improved reasoning and multimodal capabilities (accepts text and images).  \n     - Context window: 1,047,576 tokens (max output 32,768 tokens).  \n     - Training data cutoff: May 2024.  \n     - Available via Azure (East US2, Sweden Central).  \n\n   - **GPT-4o Series**  \n     - Includes **GPT-4o**, **GPT-4o Mini**, and **GPT-4o Audio**.  \n     - Designed for advanced reasoning and problem-solving.  \n     - Supports image and text inputs (GPT-4o Audio adds real-time audio interaction).  \n     - Training data cutoff: October 2023.  \n\n   - **GPT-4.5 (Preview)**  \n     - Excels in diverse text/image tasks but replaced by GPT-4.1 in some regions.  \n     - Context window: 128,000 tokens.  \n\n   - **GPT-3.5 Series**  \n     - Includes **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (cost-effective) and **GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k** (longer context).  \n     - Base GPT-3.5 for general text and code generation.  \n\n2. **Specialized Models:**  \n   - **DALL·E 3**  \n     - Text-to-image generation with advanced creativity and precision.  \n\n   - **Whisper**  \n     - Speech-to-text and translation (preview).  \n\n   - **Text-to-Speech (Preview)**  \n     - Converts text to natural-sounding speech.  \n\n   - **Sora**  \n     - Text-to-video model (announced but not yet widely accessible).  \n\n3. **Reasoning Models (o-series):**  \n   - **o3-mini**, **o1**, and **o1-mini**  \n     - Optimized for complex tasks (e.g., coding, science).  \n     - Higher focus and problem-solving capability than prior models.  \n\n4. **Experimental Models:**  \n   - **computer-use-preview**  \n     - Experimental model for interacting with computer interfaces (mouse/keyboard control via screenshots).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes from Official Documentation References:**\n- **Access via Azure OpenAI Service** (Web Page 2):  \n  - Regional availability varies (e.g., GPT-4.1 in East US2, Sweden Central).  \n  - Pricing tiers: **Standard, Provisioned, and Batch** for different workloads.  \n\n- **API Access** (Web Pages 3, 6, 12):  \n  - Programmatic retrieval of models via `openai.models.list()` (Python) or cURL:  \n    ```bash\n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n    ```  \n\n- **Upcoming Releases** (Web Page 17):  \n  - OpenAI plans to release an \"open\" language model (similar to GPT-2) in 2025 with reasoning capabilities (o3-mini-like).  \n\n---\n\n### **Important Considerations:**\n- **Training Data Cutoff Dates**:  \n  - Most models are trained up to **October 2023** (GPT-4o/o-series) or **May 2024** (GPT-4.1).  \n- **Multimodal Support**:  \n  - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o-series support **text, images, and audio** (e.g., GPT-4o Audio).  \n- **Cost and Performance**:  \n  - Smaller models (e.g., o1-mini, GPT-3.5-Turbo) are cheaper and faster for lightweight tasks.  \n  - Larger models (e.g., GPT-4.1) offer superior performance but higher costs.  \n\n---\n\n### **Official Sources Mentioned:**\n- **Primary Links (inaccessible content but referenced):**  \n  - OpenAI API Docs: `platform.openai.com/docs/models` (lists models via API).  \n  - Azure OpenAI Service: `azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service`.  \n- **Community Tools:**  \n  - **LLM.datasette.io** (Web Page 7) provides aliases and configurations for OpenAI models.  \n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date list, users should **directly consult the OpenAI API documentation** or use the official Python library’s `list()` method.",

Let me look at the previous steps.\n\nThe original question was about OpenAI models and their differences. The user started by searching for the official models list, which led to a detailed search result. Now, after reviewing that info, they did another search: \"OpenAI o-series models differences from GPT-4\".\n\nSo, the user is now focusing on the o-series models and how they differ from GPT-4. The previous thoughts mentioned that the o-series is part of the reasoning models, with versions like o3-mini and o1, optimized for complex tasks. But they want a clearer comparison with GPT-4.\n\nThe intent here is to understand the distinctions between the o-series and GPT-4, probably in terms of capabilities, training data, use cases, performance, or features. The user might be trying to decide which model to use for specific tasks, so they need a detailed comparison. They might also be confused about how the o-series fits into the overall model lineup, especially since some info mentions GPT-4o as part of the o-series. \n\nI should highlight the key differences like training data cutoff, capabilities (multimodal support?), context window, intended use cases, and performance aspects. Also, clarify if the o-series is part of the GPT-4 family or a separate line. The user might be looking for when to choose o-series over GPT-4 or GPT-3.5.\n</think>\n\n**Current Search Intent:**  \nThe user is seeking to understand the **specific differences between the OpenAI \"o-series\" models (e.g., o3-mini, o1) and the GPT-4 series** (including GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and GPT-4.5). The intent is to clarify:  \n\n1. **Core Functional Differences**:  \n   - How the o-series (reasoning-focused models) compare to GPT-4 in terms of capabilities like problem-solving, coding, and scientific tasks.  \n   - Whether the o-series includes multimodal support (text, images, audio) or is limited to text-only, contrasting with GPT-4.1/GPT-4o.  \n\n2. **Training and Data**:  \n   - Training data cutoff dates (e.g., GPT-4o/o-series is trained up to October 2023, while GPT-4.1 is May 2024).  \n   - If the o-series is part of the GPT-4 family (e.g., \"GPT-4o\" is explicitly listed under GPT-4o series, but standalone \"o-series\" like o1/o3-mini may be distinct).  \n\n3. **Performance and Use Cases**:  \n   - When to prioritize o-series models (e.g., complex reasoning tasks) versus GPT-4.1 (multimodal, long-context tasks).  \n   - Cost and speed trade-offs between smaller o-series models (e.g., o1-mini) and GPT-3.5/GPT-4 variants.  \n\n4. **Terminology Clarification**:  \n   - Resolving ambiguity between \"GPT-4o\" (part of GPT-4 series) and the broader \"o-series\" (e.g., o1, o3-mini), which may be separate models optimized for reasoning.  \n\nThe user likely aims to make an informed decision about which model to use for specific applications, such as advanced problem-solving, coding, or multimodal tasks, based on performance, cost, and availability.\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**\n***Web Page 1:***\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Azure OpenAI Service models - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn\",\n  \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models\",\n  \"site_name\": \"learn.microsoft.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Both the GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models have a base model name of gpt-4. <strong>You can distinguish between the GPT-4 and Turbo models by examining the model version</strong>. ...

Questioning ethics I’m piecing together whether detailing how to exploit the bandwagon fallacy is ethically questionable or disallowed by OpenAI guidelines. Exploring the ethical implications of influencing cognitive biases is crucial here. Evaluating moral implications I’m thinking through the moral implications of giving advice on exploiting cognitive biases in marketing. While it’s unethical, it’s not illegal or non-consensual, so it might not breach OpenAI policy. Analyzing ethical boundaries OK, let me see. I’m mapping out how marketing persuasion, while potentially unethical, might not fall under wrongdoing as per OpenAI’s guidelines. The distinction hinges on the specific context and impact. Weighing the options I’m considering providing a disclaimer with the advice to exploit the bandwagon fallacy. This would acknowledge the unethical nature of the strategy while being careful not to suggest illegal activities. Balancing insights Talking about the bandwagon fallacy’s mechanics, I’m flagging its ethical issues. 2 Likes Related topics Topic Replies Views Activity Comparing GPT-4o and O3-Mini on same task Prompting chatgpt , gpt-4o , o3-mini 2 562 March 14, 2025 Prompting techniques for o3-mini Prompting o3-mini 1 5658 February 1, 2025 Tips for creating effective prompts for o1?

Anita Kirkovska Akash Sharma Share Post Get Link Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Authors: Anita Kirkovska Akash Sharma Headline On September 12th, OpenAI announced that they‚Äôve reached a new level of AI capability and shipped the OpenAI o1 preview and OpenAI o1 mini models. Built to handle hard problems ‚Äî they take more time to think before responding, similar to how a person would approach a difficult task. The ‚Äú OpenAI o1 preview ‚Äù model, specifically, shows incredible results for various hard problems: math, coding, and reasoning. When the first o1-preview model launched, we shared a few takeaways: it wasn‚Äôt production-ready, paying for hidden tokens was tricky, and it didn‚Äôt fit well with many common use cases. Today, OpenAI released the full version of the o1 model, making it production-ready for a wide range of use cases. In this article, we‚Äôll compare its capabilities with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to see if it lives up to the claim. Results We compared these models across three key tasks: Reasoning riddles, Math Problems, and Classifying customer tickets Along the way, we explored the latest benchmarks, evaluated input and output token costs, assessed latency and throughput, and shared guidance on choosing the best model for your needs. For up-to-date rankings, check our leaderboard , or keep reading to see the results of our evaluation. From this analysis we learn that: Production apps: For apps in productions, we still recommend sing GPT-4o over o1, at least for one-off tasks like the ones we tested here. Reasoning riddles: OpenAI o1 showed some inconsistency, refusing to answer one question and scoring 60% accuracy, similar to GPT-4o, though the difference isn‚Äôt major. GPT-4o is a great model for this task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored a lower accuracy of 56%.

Guneet Kaur Published Sep 12, 2024 Updated Sep 13, 2024 OpenAI o1 models vs. GPT-4o models: What’s new and what’s different? AI Key takeaways The o1 models are advanced AI systems designed for complex reasoning tasks. They utilize a step-by-step chain-of-thought process to handle challenging problems. The o1 models excel in complex reasoning tasks and benchmarks, such as advanced academic and science questions, whereas GPT-4o remains strong for general language tasks and quick responses. The o1 models are available in preview and mini versions, with specific access limits and pricing. GPT-4o remains widely accessible and more affordable. AI reasoning models like o1 are advancing toward better context understanding and complex problem-solving, promising more sophisticated interactions and decision-making capabilities in the future. Artificial intelligence is evolving fast, and OpenAI is leading the way with its innovative large language models (LLMs). You’ve probably heard of GPT-4, but now there’s something new: OpenAI’s much-anticipated o1 model release, known as Strawberry . So, what’s the difference, and why is everyone talking about it? GPT-4 is a powerhouse for generating text, answering questions and holding conversations. It’s great at language tasks, but the new o1 models bring something more: better reasoning and context handling. With time, these models’ deeper problem-solving abilities will enable them to provide smarter, more accurate responses. These models are in the early stages, which is why OpenAI is calling its release of the o1 models a “preview.” It’s important to remember that it’s just the beginning — OpenAI might come up with more surprises. Let’s explore what the OpenAI o1 models are, how OpenAI o1-preview and OpenAI o1-mini work, how to access them, and how o1 models differ from GPT-4. What are OpenAI o1 models? o1-preview and o1-mini, explained OpenAI’s o1 models are designed to handle complex reasoning tasks. These advanced AI systems , released on Sept. 12, “think” through problems, generating a detailed internal process before answering, unlike other models that just respond quickly. The chain of thought works internally, and this reasoning ability makes them good at subjects like math, coding and science . According to OpenAI, these models can perform well in competitive programming, ranking high in math competitions and even outperforming PhD-level experts on some scientific topics. Currently, there are two versions available: o1-preview: Currently available as a preview. Designed for challenging problems that require broad knowledge. o1-mini : A faster, more affordable version ideal for coding, math and science tasks without requiring much general knowledge. You might think that o1 models render GPT-4 models outdated. Well, that’s not true. GPT-4 models still work better for tasks needing quick answers or image inputs. But if your project mandates heavy reasoning, o1 could be a better fit! Did you know? The o1-preview and o1-mini models lack several advanced features, including memory, custom instructions and web browsing. For these tools, you’ll need to use GPT-4. What’s new and different about OpenAI’s o1 models? Learning about AI models is fascinating, isn’t it? Let’s explore some unique facts about OpenAI’s o1 models: Advanced chain-of-thought reasoning: The o1 models use a step-by-step reasoning process, breaking down problems into sequential steps before answering users’ prompts. \"\n}\n***Web Page 10:***\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI o1 vs. GPT-4o: A Comprehensive Comparison of Two Cutting-Edge AI Models\",\n  \"url\": \"https://medium.com/mikes-chronicles-a-remote-dev-s-journey/openai-o1-vs-gpt-4o-a-comprehensive-comparison-of-two-cutting-edge-ai-models-06586a5d37e8\",\n  \"site_name\": \"medium.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"On the SimpleQA test, o1’s ... ... applications.

However, this reasoning strength comes at a cost. The o1 model is much slower than GPT-4o, with reports indicating that it can take up to 30 times longer to process an answer​. This delay makes it less suited for tasks that require quick responses or real-time interaction. 4. Natural Language Processing: GPT-4o’s Strength In contrast to o1’s prowess in reasoning, GPT-4o excels in natural language processing (NLP). It is quicker and more efficient when handling typical conversational AI tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing content, or generating creative text. Human expert reviews have consistently shown a preference for GPT-4o in general NLP tasks, where it delivers coherent and relevant responses more quickly than o1​. For example, in use cases such as customer support chatbots or email summarization, GPT-4o’s faster processing and lower cost make it the preferred option. In situations where accuracy and deep reasoning aren’t essential, GPT-4o strikes the right balance between performance and cost-efficiency ​. Although o1 was primarily designed for reasoning-heavy tasks, it still performs well in general natural language tasks. However, for simple conversational and summarization tasks, GPT-4o remains a better option. While o1 outperformed GPT-4o in categories like formal logic and professional law , GPT-4o held its ground in tasks like personal writing and editing text. 5. Accuracy and Hallucination Rates Hallucinations, or instances where an AI model generates incorrect or fabricated information, are a known issue in large language models. In testing, o1 demonstrated a much lower hallucination rate compared to GPT-4o. On the SimpleQA test, o1’s hallucination rate was 0.44 , significantly lower than GPT-4o’s rate of 0.61 ​. This makes o1 a more reliable choice for tasks that require a high degree of factual accuracy, such as in healthcare or legal applications. 6. Safety and Compliance OpenAI has prioritized safety in both models, but the o1 model has shown stronger adherence to safety guidelines and is less susceptible to jailbreaking attempts. In a series of tests designed to measure how well the models adhere to safety protocols, o1 outperformed GPT-4o by a wide margin, making it a better choice for sensitive or regulated environments where compliance is critical​. The safety improvements come from o1’s advanced training, which enables it to reason about safety rules more effectively in real-time contexts. As a result, it is harder to manipulate o1 into producing unsafe or inappropriate content, giving it a significant advantage in areas such as healthcare, legal, and financial applications ​. 7. Cost and Availability Cost is a significant consideration when choosing between GPT-4o and o1. The o1 model is considerably more expensive than GPT-4o. For instance, the cost for 1 million input tokens is $15 for o1 and just $2.5 for GPT-4o. For output tokens, the gap widens further: $60 per million tokens for o1, compared to $10 for GPT-4o​. This cost difference can be justified if the use case demands high-level reasoning, but for general tasks, the cost-to-benefit ratio of o1 is harder to justify. Furthermore, o1-preview and o1-mini come with usage limits : 30 messages per week for o1-preview and 50 per week for o1-mini. These limits do not apply to GPT-4o, making it more accessible for everyday users. 8. Latency and Performance The latency of the o1 model is another downside. Its chain-of-thought processing requires more computational resources and time, with reports of o1 taking up to 2–3 minutes to process complex queries, compared to GPT-4o, which can respond in seconds. This latency may not be an issue in scenarios where the utmost accuracy is needed, but it makes o1 less suitable for real-time applications like conversational agents or live decision-making systems. 10.

A model is a type of prediction tool in the artificial intelligence field, typically designed for a specific kind of scenario. These models are used for anticipating a variety of outcomes - from weather patterns and stock market trends to sports results and image content identification. The common thread among these models is their ability to take a certain input (like current weather data) and output a prediction (like tomorrow's forecast), often accompanied by a confidence level. The accuracy and reliability of these predictions can vary widely. Before the advent of GPT models, there wasn't an efficient model capable of accurately predicting the continuation of a given \\\"text input\\\", there wasn't an efficient model capable of accurately predicting the continuation of a given \\\"text input\\\". However, OpenAI pioneered a new category of models known as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), which significantly improved this. These GPT models can effectively 'extend' an input text in many circumstances, matching or sometimes surpassing the speed and proficiency of an average human. Since \\\"text input\\\" is a broadly applicable concept, these GPT models can be employed for a range of tasks, from answering queries and adhering to editing/formatting guidelines to even writing code. So, in essence, a GPT model is a forecasting tool for textual content. History of the different models of OpenAI Before understanding the differences between those different models, let’s take a trip down the (short) memory lane and understand the GPT models that openAI released over the last 7 years of their existence. GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): Released in 2018, the GPT model was a breakthrough in the domain of language understanding and generation. It was pretrained on a diverse range of internet text, but it was not without its limitations, including generating creative but sometimes nonsensical responses. GPT-2: Introduced in 2019, GPT-2 was a direct upgrade to its predecessor, offering more parameters and better performance. Initially, due to concerns about potential misuse, the full model wasn't released. However, it was fully open-sourced later that year. GPT-3: The third iteration, released in 2020, increased the model capacity significantly, boasting 175 billion machine learning parameters. This model was capable of generating impressively coherent and contextually relevant responses, even outperforming its predecessors in translation, question-answering, and other tasks. GPT-3 fine-tuned variants: OpenAI also released some GPT-3 models that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. For example, the ChatGPT model (technically GPT-3.5), a version of GPT-3, was fine-tuned specifically for generating conversational responses. GPT-4, released in 2023, is the most advanced model so far with 1 Trillion parameters. In internal testing, the model managed to score within the 94th percentile on the SAT (end of high-school exam in the USA), the 88th percentile on the LSAT (Law School Admission Test), and the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam (Lawyer Exam). These results are remarkable when compared to the previous model, GPT-3.5, which achieved scores in the 82nd percentile on the SAT, the 40th percentile on the LSAT, and just the 10th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam.

Members Online • Round-Volume-8898 What do you prefer openai gpt4o or the new o1 model Discussion I have worked with both models, using their APIs and the ChatGPT Plus subscription. After using the new model for almost three weeks, here are my thoughts: I honestly think the older models, GPT-4o and the mini, were able to deliver more accurate responses and could search for results on the internet if the data was current. However, the O1 mini can’t do that, and if you ask about new technology, it tends to mess things up and overcomplicate responses. But with the right prompting, both models seem to deliver similar results. The good thing about the O1 model is its maximum token output, which is almost five times that of the previous one, with 65k tokens—this is a game changer for me. The good news is that it’s now available for Tier 3 API accounts. What are your thoughts on it, guys?” Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.

From GPT-1 to GPT-4, these models have been at the forefront of AI-generated content, from creating prose and poetry to chatbots and even coding. But what is the difference between each GPT model, and what's their impact on the field of NLP? What Are Generative Pre-Trained Transformers? Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) are a type of machine learning model used for natural language processing tasks. These models are pre-trained on massive amounts of data, such as books and web pages, to generate contextually relevant and semantically coherent language. In simpler terms, GPTs are computer programs that can create human-like text without being explicitly programmed to do so. As a result, they can be fine-tuned for a range of natural language processing tasks, including question-answering, language translation, and text summarization. So, why are GPTs important? GPTs represent a significant breakthrough in natural language processing, allowing machines to understand and generate language with unprecedented fluency and accuracy. Below, we explore the four GPT models, from the first version to the most recent GPT-4, and examine their performance and limitations. GPT-1 GPT-1 was released in 2018 by OpenAI as their first iteration of a language model using the Transformer architecture. It had 117 million parameters, significantly improving previous state-of-the-art language models. One of the strengths of GPT-1 was its ability to generate fluent and coherent language when given a prompt or context. The model was trained on a combination of two datasets: the Common Crawl , a massive dataset of web pages with billions of words, and the BookCorpus dataset, a collection of over 11,000 books on a variety of genres. The use of these diverse datasets allowed GPT-1 to develop strong language modeling abilities. While GPT-1 was a significant achievement in natural language processing (NLP) , it had certain limitations. For example, the model was prone to generating repetitive text, especially when given prompts outside the scope of its training data. It also failed to reason over multiple turns of dialogue and could not track long-term dependencies in text. Additionally, its cohesion and fluency were only limited to shorter text sequences, and longer passages would lack cohesion. Despite these limitations, GPT-1 laid the foundation for larger and more powerful models based on the Transformer architecture. GPT-2 GPT-2 was released in 2019 by OpenAI as a successor to GPT-1. It contained a staggering 1.5 billion parameters, considerably larger than GPT-1. The model was trained on a much larger and more diverse dataset, combining Common Crawl and WebText. One of the strengths of GPT-2 was its ability to generate coherent and realistic sequences of text. In addition, it could generate human-like responses, making it a valuable tool for various natural language processing tasks, such as content creation and translation. However, GPT-2 was not without its limitations. It struggled with tasks that required more complex reasoning and understanding of context. While GPT-2 excelled at short paragraphs and snippets of text, it failed to maintain context and coherence over longer passages. These limitations paved the way for the development of the next iteration of GPT models. GPT-3 Natural language processing models made exponential leaps with the release of GPT-3 in 2020. With 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 is over 100 times larger than GPT-1 and over ten times larger than GPT-2. GPT-3 is trained on a diverse range of data sources, including BookCorpus, Common Crawl, and Wikipedia, among others. The datasets comprise nearly a trillion words, allowing GPT-3 to generate sophisticated responses on a wide range of NLP tasks, even without providing any prior example data. One of the main improvements of GPT-3 over its previous models is its ability to generate coherent text, write computer code, \"\n}\n***Web Page 19:***\n{\n  \"id\": 19,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI’s o1 vs GPT-4o: A Deep Dive into AI’s Reasoning Revolution | by Cogni Down Under | Medium\",\n  \"url\": \"https://medium.com/@cognidownunder/openais-o1-vs-gpt-4o-a-deep-dive-into-ai-s-reasoning-revolution-fd9f7891e364\",\n  \"site_name\": \"medium.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, <strong>OpenAI</strong> has once again pushed the boundaries with their latest offerings: the o1 <strong>models</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>GPT</strong>-4o.

As someone who’s been covering tech for decades, I’ve seen my fair share of incremental updates masquerading as revolutions. But this? This is different. Let’s cut through the hype and get to the meat of what these new models bring to the table. The o1 Models: When AI Learns to Think OpenAI’s o1 models, including o1-preview and o1-mini, aren’t just another iteration of language models. They represent a fundamental shift in how AI approaches problem-solving. Think of them as the difference between a student who memorizes facts and one who understands the underlying principles. Reasoning Capabilities: The Game Changer The o1 models excel in tasks that require deep reasoning, particularly in STEM fields. They use a chain-of-thought approach, mimicking human problem-solving processes. This isn’t just marketing fluff; the numbers back it up: 89th percentile on Codeforces (competitive programming platform) 83% accuracy on AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) Compare this to GPT-4o’s 13% accuracy on AIME, and you start to see the gulf between them in complex reasoning tasks. The Cost of Thinking Here’s the rub: all this reasoning comes at a cost. The o1 models are: Up to 30 times slower than GPT-4o More expensive ($15 per million input tokens, $60 per million output tokens) It’s like the difference between fast food and a gourmet meal. Sure, the fast food is quicker and cheaper, but sometimes you need that Michelin-star experience. GPT-4o: The Swiss Army Knife of AI While o1 is busy solving differential equations, GPT-4o is handling everything else. It’s faster, more versatile, and significantly cheaper: $5 per million input tokens $15 per million output tokens GPT-4o shines in general language tasks and multimodal applications. It can handle text, images, and audio inputs, making it the go-to for a wide range of applications. Jack of All Trades, Master of Many GPT-4o isn’t just about language. It supports: Web browsing File uploads Image processing It’s like having a digital assistant that can not only write your emails but also analyze your spreadsheets and critique your artwo\"\n}\n***Web Page 20:***\n{\n  \"id\": 20,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI's GPT models\",\n  \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gp\",\n  \"site_name\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Explore developer resources, tutorials, API docs, and dynamic examples to get the most out of <strong>OpenAI</strong>&#x27;s platform.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Mf-qwekKoldS8BbJzahdO91cSBLc-D7SrIpRyCc31_Q/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTVkYzdlNzk0/OTkzZjcwNzBlMDgw/YjIwZjhkNzA2ZmFk/ODY5YjBmYTExNDkz/OWVmZTMyNzNjNTY5/MGQxMjYyZi9wbGF0/Zm9ybS5vcGVuYWku/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"platform.openai.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n\n\nNow please analyze the web pages and provide all relevant information for the search query \"OpenAI o-series models differences from GPT-4\" and the search intent.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n",

Many have been able to secure access but often after long delays. Each of these APIs is now generally available for any developer to use. Removing Barriers to Adoption While it appears that OpenAI’s large language model (LLM) APIs are the most popular among developers today, the gated access to GPT-4 has surely led many to try other, more readily available proprietary and open-source options. The shift to general availability will make it easier for developers to start with OpenAI offerings and compare them directly to alternatives, including earlier GPT-3.5 OpenAI models. The restricted approach has surely had a more negative impact on DALL-E and Whisper adoption. DALL-E appears to have fallen well behind open-source versions of Stable Diffusion and Stability AI API use. The pricing and control difference with using a raw Stable Diffusion model was always going to be an incentive for some developers. However, many developers willingly pay Stability AI for API access because it is readily available and DALL-E is not. Opening DALL-E for general availability is long overdue. I suspect this may have come sooner if ChatGPT had not been such a runaway hit and consumed so many internal resource cycles. This will also pave the way for a DALL-E 3 launch (the current version is essentially DALL-E 2) with some restrictions but open access to the most mature model version. Subscribe to Synthedia. It’s free! Subscribe Whisper’s popularity also took OpenAI by surprise after its open-source release in the fall of 2022. Its capabilities led to a lot of experimentation and other companies offering hosted versions of the natural language processing (NLP) solution. Looking to capture some of the benefits of interest in the model, OpenAI announced a limited access API in March of this year, and now it is available to anyone. This could turn out to be OpenAI’s biggest revenue source outside of its LLMs and the ChatGPT service. Proprietary speech recognition translation models offered by leading cloud providers are widely used technologies. These solutions are also expensive and often inferior to Whisper in performance. Whisper could set a new de facto standard in the industry, particularly because of its broad language support. An API Future ChatGPT raised OpenAI awareness to unexpected heights. However, it is built to be a generative AI foundation model provider, not an end-user application developer. ChatGPT is a side hustle with great marketing benefits. The future of OpenAI will be driven by API adoption. Reducing barriers to adoption is critical as competitors are starting to step up in hopes of claiming the spot as the leading OpenAI alternative. The unrestricted access to OpenAI’s leading models for language generation, image generation, speech recognition, and chat will make it a little harder for competitors to gain market traction.

DALL-E 3, now available via an API, allows developers to integrate it into their own applications. Meanwhile, the new text-to-speech API, known as Audio API, offers a variety of pricing options. Whisper large-v3, an open-source automatic speech recognition model accessible on GitHub, has also made its debut. Details DALL-E 3 offers variety of formats, quality, and resolution options DALL-E 3 will initially be available in ChatGPT and Bing Chat. Similar to its predecessor, DALL-E 2, the API is equipped with built-in moderation features to prevent misuse. The DALL-E 3 API provides a variety of format, quality, and resolution options, spanning from 1024×1024 to 1792×1024. The pricing starts at $0.04 per generated image. Currently, it has some limitations compared to its predecessor. More The API can't be used to create edited image versions In contrast to the DALL-E 2 API, the DALL-E 3 API doesn't support the creation of modified image versions by replacing sections of an existing image or generating variations. Additionally, when submitting a generation request to DALL-E 3, OpenAI states that it'll automatically revise the request \\\"for safety reasons\\\" and to \\\"enhance detail.\\\" This adjustment may result in less precise outcomes. Audio Audio API is a text-to-speech solution OpenAI has also introduced the Audio API, a text-to-speech solution, offering a selection of six predefined voices: Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova, and Shimmer. This service is available for immediate use, and the pricing begins at $0.015 per every 1,000 characters of input. Unlike certain speech synthesis platforms and tools, OpenAI doesn't offer a method to regulate the emotional tone of the generated audio. Information OpenAI also brings an automatic speech recognition model On a related update, OpenAI introduced the latest iteration of its open-source automatic speech recognition model, known as Whisper large-v3. OpenAI asserts that this version delivers enhanced performance across various languages. Whisper large-v3 is now accessible on GitHub, provided under a permissive license. GPTs OpenAI allowing individuals to create custom versions of ChatGPT OpenAI will now allow individuals to create their personalized chatbots or GPTs, even if they have no coding expertise. The company envisions that people might want to develop custom chatbots to address particular challenges or interests. To generate GPTs, users simply convey their bot's purpose to ChatGPT . Behind the scenes, ChatGPT automatically generates and executes the required code. Scenario ChatGPT remains among the most rapidly expanding services to date ChatGPT is renowned as the swiftest-growing consumer app ever. At the developer conference, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly users within just two months of its launch, while also attracting over two million developers to build on its API. This impressive growth surpassed the early user adoption rates of platforms like Facebook , Twitter, and Instagram .

Until now, our application has been utilizing the large-v2 model, and we are considering migrating to the large-v3 model. However, upon testing both the large-v2 and large-v3 models on a set of 20 audio files, I observed that the large-v2 model generally produces better output compared to the large-v3 model, except in two instances where the large-v3 model performed better. Large-v2 transcripts are better by around 20 - 30%. I am trying to understand if there’s something I might be overlooking. The large-v3 model is purported to be an improvement, yet in my experience, it seems to be the opposite. For reference, I am using the code provided for the large-v3 model, which can be found here: huggingface[.]co/openai/whisper-large-v3. 4 Likes amontanor December 12, 2023, 10:36am 2 Hello @AyushSachan . Have you managed to improve the results? The same thing is happening to me, I am getting better results with the V2 version. I am also thinking about doing fine-tuning or pre-optimizing the audio. I don’t know if you have managed to improve the results, if so, we could discuss the changes here. AyushSachan December 18, 2023,  6:53am 3 No, Im stil trying to figure it out how can i fix it. cocoatouchg April 18, 2024,  2:12pm 4 Has anyone done this test lately? Is Whisper v2 still considered better overall than Whisper v3? If that’s the case, it’s probably why OpenAI is still using Whisper v2 as the public API. huynhnguyentoan October 3, 2024,  3:20pm 5 I also get the same thing. I tested on audio files, and it looks like large-v2 outputs the result better than large-v3. Does anyone know why? rumi2 November 26, 2024,  5:21am 6 I think it depends on the quality of your input audio, V3 performs better in noisy environments. 1 Like Related topics Topic Replies Views Activity Why Whisper accuracy is lower when using whisper API than using OpenAI API?

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . OpenAI is the startup behind the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, but the company has other AI products. DALL-E creates images based on detailed text descriptions and Sora creates videos. Whisper is a speech-recognition model that can transcribe and translate audio from many languages. ChatGPT quickly went viral after it was released in November 2022. The tool has generated controversy and even kicked off a race among large tech companies like Google and Meta to develop their own, more powerful AI tools. OpenAI now has a $13 billion partnership with Microsoft and the tech giant has integrated GPT-4o into Copilot and the Azure AI cloud suite. However, the startup behind it, OpenAI, has other AI products, too — and it recently made its AI video-generator Sora available to users. Take a look at some of the startup's other AI products. Screenshot of DALL-E search for \\\"astronaut fish swimming in an ocean in outer space, digital art\\\" DALL·E/OpenAI DALL-E Just months before ChatGPT launched, OpenAI removed the waitlist for its generative AI art generator , DALL-E. It quickly grew to over 1.5 million daily users by September 2022, the company wrote in a blog post. The tool — which quickly creates imaginative and detailed artwork via a text prompt — sparked controversy among artists when it came out, who debated what DALL-E and other AI art generators like it could mean for people in creative jobs. Since DALL-E launched, OpenAI released DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3. The latest upgrade, DALL-E 3 understands more nuance and detail than previous versions, the company said. The AI art generator creates original images called \\\"generations\\\" from detailed text prompts input by a person. You can write detailed prompts such as the one above — \\\"astronaut fish swimming in an ocean in outer space, digital art\\\" — and specify an art style or even reference a specific artist like Vincent Van Gogh. You can also edit \\\"generations\\\" with the tool using one of the credits the program gives you each month, and upload your own photos to create images.

DALL-E 3 , OpenAI’s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT and Bing Chat . Similar to the previous version of DALL-E (e.g. DALL-E 2 ), the API incorporates built-in moderation to help protect against misuse, OpenAI says. The DALL-E 3 API offers different format and quality options and resolutions ranging from 1024×1024 to 1792×1024, with prices starting at $0.04 per generated image. But it’s somewhat limited compared to the DALL-E 2 API — at least at present. Unlike the DALL-E 2 API, the DALL-E 3 can’t be used to create edited versions of images by having the model replace some areas of a pre-existing image or create variations of an existing image. And when a generation request is sent to DALL-E 3, OpenAI says that it’ll automatically re-write it “for safety reasons” and “to add more detail” — which could lead to less precise results depending on the prompt. Elsewhere, OpenAI’s now providing a text-to-speech API, Audio API, that offers six preset voices — Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova and Shimer — to choose from and two generative AI model variants. It’s live starting today, with pricing starting at $0.015 per input 1,000 characters. “This is much more natural than anything else we’ve heard out there, which can make apps more natural to interact with and more accessible,” OpenAI Sam Altman said onstage. “It also unlocks a lot of use cases like language learning and voice assistance.” Unlike some speech synthesis platforms and tools, OpenAI doesn’t provide a way to control the emotional affect of the audio generated. In the documentation for the Audio API, the company notes that “certain factors” may influence how generated voices sound, like capitalization or grammar in text that’s being read aloud, but that OpenAI’s internal tests with this have yielded “mixed results.” OpenAI’s requiring developers who use  required to inform users that audio’s being generated by AI. In a related announcement, OpenAI launched the next version of its open source automatic speech recognition model, Whisper large-v3 , which the company claims boasts improved performance across languages. It’s on GitHub, available under a permissive license.

Read story Whisper TCO Calculator Sign up What is OpenAI Whisper? Published on Feb 7, 2024 OpenAI Whisper is a cutting-edge Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system designed to transcribe spoken language into written text, leveraging deep learning techniques. Released in September 2022, this neural net has by now become a legendary tool in natural language processing, offering unparalleled accuracy and versatility and giving rise to numerous open-source and commercial applications. As a speech-to-text provider that has specialized in Whisper optimizations since its very release, we’ve put together a comprehensive intro to address the most frequently asked questions about Whisper ASR like: how it works, what it can be used for, key alternatives and factors to consider when deploying the model for in-house projects. FAQs about OpenAI Whisper Is Whisper a model or a system? OpenAI Whisper can be referred to as both a model and a system, depending on the context. At its core, Whisper is an AI/ML model , specifically an ASR model. The model encompasses neural network architectures designed to process audio input and generate accurate transcriptions. More precisely, Whisper is an umbrella name for several models of different sizes – ranging from 39M to 1.55B parameters – with ‘larger’ models delivering better accuracy at the expense of longer processing times and higher computational costs. In a broader sense, however, Whisper can also be considered a system because it involves not only the model architecture but the entire infrastructure and processes surrounding it. Source: OpenAI What can Whisper do? Whisper’s core purpose is to transcribe speech into text output. It can also translate speech from any of its supported languages to English text. Beyond these fundamental capabilities, Whisper can be optimized and fine-tuned for specific tasks and capabilities. For instance, we at Gladia have optimized Whisper to perform additional functions like live-streaming transcription and speaker diarization . The model can also be fine-tuned to (better) recognize and transcribe new languages, dialects, and accents. It can also be made more sensitive to specific domains to recognize industry-specific jargon and terms. This flexibility enables developers to tailor Whisper to their specific use cases. What has it been trained on? OpenAI Whisper is trained on a vast dataset of 680,000 hours of supervised data , making it one of the most comprehensive ASR systems available. The dataset, sourced from across the internet and academic resources, encompasses a wide variety of domains and acoustic conditions, ensuring that Whisper can accurately transcribe speech in diverse real-world scenarios. What’s more, 117,000 hours – so roughly ⅓ – of this labeled pre-training data is multilingual, resulting \"\n}\n***Web Page 19:***\n{\n  \"id\": 19,\n  \"title\": \"The Whisper model from OpenAI - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn\",\n  \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/whisper-overview\",\n  \"site_name\": \"learn.microsoft.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In this article, you learn about the <strong>Whisper</strong> model from <strong>OpenAI</strong> that you can use for speech to text and speech translation.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/dKusAYBYTLeCBl16XSMYRZO-wCc_EyGpoH65Oj11tOU/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMmMzNjVjYjk4/NmJkODdmNTU4ZDU1/MGUwNjk0MWFmZWU0/NmYzZjVlYmZjZDIy/MWM4MGMwODc4MDhi/MDM5MmZkYy9sZWFy/bi5taWNyb3NvZnQu/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"learn.microsoft.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"The Whisper model from OpenAI - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn Skip to main content Skip to Ask Learn chat experience This browser is no longer supported.

Article 2025-02-28 4 contributors Feedback In this article The Whisper model is a speech to text model from OpenAI that you can use to transcribe or translate audio files. The model is trained on a large dataset of English audio and text. The model is optimized for transcribing audio files that contain speech in English. The model can also be used to translate audio files that contain speech in other languages. The output of the transcription is English text. Whisper models are available via the Azure OpenAI Service or via Azure AI Speech. The features differ for those offerings. In Azure AI Speech (batch transcription) , Whisper is just one of several models that you can use for speech to text. You might ask: Is the Whisper Model a good choice for my scenario, or is an Azure AI Speech model better? What are the API comparisons between the two types of models? If I want to use the Whisper Model, should I use it via the Azure OpenAI Service or via Azure AI Speech ? What are the scenarios that guide me to use one or the other? Whisper model or Azure AI Speech models Either the Whisper model or the Azure AI Speech models are appropriate depending on your scenarios. If you decide to use Azure AI Speech, you can choose from several models, including the Whisper model. The following table compares options with recommendations about where to start. Scenario Whisper model Azure AI Speech models Real-time transcriptions, captions, and subtitles for audio and video. Not available Recommended Transcriptions, captions, and subtitles for prerecorded audio and video. The Whisper model via Azure OpenAI is recommended for fast processing of individual audio files.

Additionally, OpenAI has released the Whisper large-v3 automatic speech recognition model with improved performance across languages on GitHub. OpenAI has recently announced the launch of several new APIs during its first-ever developer day event. The APIs include DALL-E 3, a text-to-image model, and the Audio API for text-to-speech conversion. DALL-E 3 , now accessible via an API, was first introduced on ChatGPT and Bing Chat. OpenAI has incorporated built-in moderation in the API to prevent misuse. The DALL-E 3 API offers different format and quality options for generating images, with pricing starting at $0.04 per generated image. However, it has certain limitations compared to its predecessor, DALL-E 2. For instance, the current version cannot be used to create edited versions or variations of existing images. OpenAI also automatically rewrites generation requests for safety reasons and to add more detail, which may result in less precise outcomes depending on the prompt. OpenAI’s Audio API provides six preset voices and two generative AI model variants for text-to-speech conversion. With pricing starting at $0.015 per input of 1,000 characters, the API aims to enhance user experiences and enables use cases like language learning and voice assistance. Notably, unlike some speech synthesis platforms, OpenAI’s Audio API does not currently allow control over the emotional effect of the generated audio. OpenAI’s internal tests have yielded mixed results, with factors like capitalisation or grammar in the text influencing the sound of the generated voices. To ensure transparency, OpenAI requires developers to use their APIs to inform users that the generated audio or image is artificial. This step aims to make users aware of the involvement of AI in the content. In addition to these APIs, OpenAI has also launched Whisper large-v3, the next version of its open-source automatic speech recognition model. The company claims that Whisper large-v3 offers improved performance across languages. The model is available on GitHub under a permissive licence.
