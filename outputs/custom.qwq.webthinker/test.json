        "Question": "What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?",
        "prompt": "<|im_start|>user\nYou are a research assistant with the ability to perform web searches to write a scientific research article. You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|>search results<|end_search_result|>.\n\n- To write a section of the research article: write <|begin_write_section|>section name\ncontents to write<|end_write_section|>.\nThen, the system will completely write the section based on your request and current gathered information.\n\n- To check the current article: write <|begin_check_article|>system returns outline of all current written contents<|end_check_article|>.\n\n- To edit the article: write <|begin_edit_article|>your detailed edit goal and instruction<|end_edit_article|>.\nThen, the system will edit the article based on your goal and instruction and current gathered information.\n\nYour task is to research and write a scientific article about:\nWhat are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\n\nHere is a research plan to guide your investigation:\nOkay, the user wants a detailed plan to search the web for information on OpenAI's models and their differences. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the best way to gather all the necessary information step by step. \n\nStarting with the basics, the first step should be to visit OpenAI's official website. That's the most reliable source for their models. They probably list all their models there with descriptions. But maybe there are more models not highlighted, so I should check their blog and research sections too.\n\nNext, I should look for recent articles or press releases. OpenAI often announces new models, so tech news sites like TechCrunch or The Verge might have updates. Also, checking Wikipedia could be useful since it might have a comprehensive list, but I need to cross-verify with official sources.\n\nThen, technical documentation is key. The OpenAI API docs would detail each model's capabilities, parameters, and use cases. Comparing the models there would show differences in features like language understanding, code generation, or performance metrics.\n\nFor community discussions, forums like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or specialized AI communities on platforms like Discord might have user experiences and comparisons. This could highlight real-world differences in performance or applications.\n\nAcademic papers from OpenAI's publications would provide in-depth technical details. ArXiv or their official research page might have papers on model architectures, training data, and innovations between versions.\n\nThird-party analyses and benchmarks are important too. Sites like Distil.pub or research papers comparing models like GPT-3 vs. GPT-3.5 could offer insights into performance metrics, efficiency, and specific use cases.\n\nSocial media and Twitter threads from AI experts might have quick summaries or comparisons. Following OpenAI's official accounts or prominent researchers could yield recent updates or discussions on model differences.\n\nLastly, checking developer forums like Stack Overflow for troubleshooting or implementation differences between models. This might reveal practical aspects like API usage, limitations, or specific scenarios where one model outperforms another.\n\nWait, did I miss any sources? Maybe GitHub repositories for any open-source models? But OpenAI's models aren't fully open-source, except maybe older ones like GPT-2. Still, including that could be a step. Hmm, but the user specified no more than 8 steps. Let me see. The steps I have cover official sources, news, docs, forums, papers, third-party analyses, social media, and developer forums. That's eight. Maybe GitHub can be part of the official site check or community discussions. I think the current steps are comprehensive enough. Let me structure them clearly.\n</think>\n\n(1) Visit OpenAI's official website to identify all publicly listed models (e.g., GPT series, DALL·E, Whisper, etc.) and their descriptions.  \n(2) Review OpenAI's blog and press releases for announcements about new models, updates, or deprecated versions.  \n(3) Explore OpenAI's technical documentation (API docs, research papers) to compare parameters, capabilities, and use cases across models.  \n(4) Search tech news platforms (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge) for articles analyzing model differences and real-world applications.  \n(5) Check Wikipedia and AI-focused wikis for structured comparisons of model generations (e.g., GPT-2 vs. GPT-3 vs. GPT-4) and their advancements.  \n(6) Investigate community forums (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow) for user discussions on model performance, limitations, and practical distinctions.  \n(7) Analyze third-party benchmarks and analyses (e.g., Distil.pub, research papers) comparing model accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency.  \n(8) Review social media (e.g., Twitter/X threads by AI experts) for concise summaries or direct quotes from OpenAI developers about model distinctions.\n\nPlease follow the research plan step by step:\n1. Use web searches to gather detailed information for each point\n2. After each search, analyze the results and determine what additional information is needed\n3. When you have sufficient information for a section, request to write that section\n4. Continue this process until the full article is complete\n5.

Here's the API reference: platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list?lang=python – Rok Benko Commented Feb 22 at 11:27 @Rob Benko - you are right - it would be more precicise to state the openai-python API has been a moving target for a while and there might be hope this approach would be stable for a reasonable time period. – Wolfgang Fahl Commented Feb 22 at 15:04 Add a comment | Start asking to get answers Find the answer to your question by asking.

It aims to develop \\\"safe and beneficial\\\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \\\"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\\\". [ 5 ] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom , [ 6 ] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models , the DALL-E series of text-to-image models , and a text-to-video model named Sora . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI . The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc . , [ 9 ] registered in Delaware , and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC. [ 10 ] Its stated mission is to ensure that AGI \\\"benefits all of humanity\\\". [ 11 ] Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity , having invested US$13 billion. [ 12 ] It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform , Microsoft Azure . [ 13 ] In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] History [ edit ] 2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings [ edit ] Former headquarters at the Pioneer Building in San Francisco In December 2015, OpenAI was founded by Sam Altman , Elon Musk , Ilya Sutskever , Greg Brockman , Trevor Blackwell , Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy , Durk Kingma, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba , with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co-chairs. A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman , Jessica Livingston , Peter Thiel , Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys , and YC Research . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019. [ 10 ] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch , while YC Research never contributed any funds, Open Philanthropy contributed $30 million and another $15 million in verifiable donations were traced back to Musk.

To stream the response body, use .with_streaming_response instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call .read() , .text() , .json() , .iter_bytes() , .iter_text() , .iter_lines() or .parse() . In the async client, these are async methods. As such, .with_streaming_response methods return a different APIResponse object, and the async client returns an AsyncAPIResponse object. with client . chat . completions . with_streaming_response . create ( messages = [\\n        { \\\"role\\\" : \\\"user\\\" , \\\"content\\\" : \\\"Say this is a test\\\" ,\\n        }\\n    ], model = \\\"gpt-4o\\\" ,\\n) as response : print ( response . headers . get ( \\\"X-My-Header\\\" )) for line in response . iter_lines (): print ( line ) The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed. Making custom/undocumented requests This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API. If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used. Undocumented endpoints To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using client.get , client.post , and other\\nhttp verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request. import httpx response = client . post ( \\\"/foo\\\" , cast_to = httpx . Response , body = { \\\"my_param\\\" : True },\\n) print ( response . headers . get ( \\\"x-foo\\\" )) Undocumented request params If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the extra_query , extra_body , and extra_headers request\\noptions. Undocumented response properties To access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like response.unknown_prop . You\\ncan also get all the extra fields on the Pydantic model as a dict with response.model_extra . Configuring the HTTP client You can directly override the httpx client to customize it for your use case, including: Support for proxies Custom transports Additional advanced functionality import httpx from openai import OpenAI , DefaultHttpxClient client = OpenAI ( # Or use the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var base_url = \\\"http://my.test.server.example.com:8083/v1\\\" , http_client = DefaultHttpxClient ( proxy = \\\"http://my.test.proxy.example.com\\\" , transport = httpx . HTTPTransport ( local_address = \\\"0.0.0.0\\\" ),\\n    ),\\n) You can also customize the client on a per-request basis by using with_options() : client . with_options ( http_client = DefaultHttpxClient (...)) Managing HTTP resources By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is garbage collected . You can manually close the client using the .close() method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting. from openai import OpenAI with OpenAI () as client : # make requests here ... # HTTP client is now closed Microsoft Azure OpenAI To use this library with Azure OpenAI , use the AzureOpenAI class in\"\n}\n***Web Page 13:***\n{\n  \"id\": 13,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI's GPT models\",\n  \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gp\",\n  \"site_name\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Explore developer resources, tutorials, API docs, and dynamic examples to get the most out of <strong>OpenAI</strong>&#x27;s platform.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Mf-qwekKoldS8BbJzahdO91cSBLc-D7SrIpRyCc31_Q/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTVkYzdlNzk0/OTkzZjcwNzBlMDgw/YjIwZjhkNzA2ZmFk/ODY5YjBmYTExNDkz/OWVmZTMyNzNjNTY5/MGQxMjYyZi9wbGF0/Zm9ybS5vcGVuYWku/Y29tLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"platform.openai.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 14:***\n{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"title\": \"Pricing\",\n  \"url\": \"https://openai.com/pricing\",\n  \"site_name\": \"openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Requests sent to fine-tuned <strong>models</strong> are billed at our usage rates.

The form, which OpenAI is inviting “developers, researchers, and [members of] the broader community” to fill out, includes questions like, “What would you like to see in an open-weight model from OpenAI?” and “What open models have you used in the past?” “We’re excited to collaborate with developers, researchers, and the broader community to gather inputs and make this model as useful as possible,” OpenAI wrote on its website. “If you’re interested in joining a feedback session with the OpenAI team, please let us know [in the form] below.” OpenAI plans to host developer events to gather feedback and, in the future, demo prototypes of the model. The first developer event will take place in San Francisco within a few weeks, followed by sessions in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. we’re releasing a model this year that you can run on your own hardware https://t.co/0ji9oezNyr — Steven Heidel (@stevenheidel) March 31, 2025 OpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an “open” approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI’s strategy, these “open” competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization. It has proven to be a wildly successful strategy for some outfits. Meta, which has invested heavily in its Llama family of open AI models, said earlier in March that Llama had racked up over 1 billion downloads . Meanwhile, DeepSeek has quickly amassed a large worldwide user base and attracted the attention of domestic investors . In a recent Reddit Q&A , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he thinks OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. “[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy,” Altman said. “Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it’s also not our current highest priority […] We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years.” Altman expanded on OpenAI’s open model plans in a post on X on Monday afternoon , saying that OpenAI’s upcoming open model will have “reasoning” capabilities along the lines of OpenAI’s o3-mini. “[B]efore release, we will evaluate this model according [to] our preparedness framework, like we would for any other model,” Altman said. “[A]nd we will do extra work given that we know this model will be modified post-release […] [W]e’re excited to see what developers build and how large companies and governments use it where they prefer to run a model themselves.” Excerpts of a forthcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey published over the weekend allege that Altman misled OpenAI executives about model safety reviews prior to his brief ouster in November 2023.

                "Output": "Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants the list of OpenAI models from the official website. First, I'll look through the provided web pages to find the most relevant info.\n\nStarting with Web Page 1: The title is \"OpenAI Platform\" and the URL points to platform.openai.com/docs/models. The snippet mentions exploring developer resources and API docs, but the page content couldn't be fetched. Since this is the official docs page, it's likely the primary source, but without the content, I need to check others.\n\nWeb Page 2 is from Azure's site, listing models like GPT-4.1, o-series, and others. Though it's Microsoft's page, it mentions Azure OpenAI Service models, which might include OpenAI's models. But the user specifically wants the official OpenAI list, so maybe this isn't the main source, but some models here could be valid.\n\nWeb Page 3 is a Stack Overflow post explaining how to get the model list via API. It shows code examples using OpenAI's Python library. The answer mentions using client.models.list(), which implies the official API can provide the list. However, the user wants the website list, not programmatic access, but this confirms the models exist.\n\nWeb Page 4 is openai.com/o1/, but the content isn't accessible. The snippet talks about AGI, so maybe not the models list.\n\nWeb Page 6 is platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list, which is an API endpoint. The user wants the website, not API details, but this reinforces that the official API provides model info.\n\nWeb Page 7 from llm.datasette.io lists models like GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, etc., under OpenAI. It's a third-party site but references OpenAI's models accurately, possibly based on API data.\n\nWeb Page 8 is OpenAI's help center about model selection in ChatGPT. It mentions switching models like GPT-4 and 3.5, which are official.\n\nWeb Page 10 from Azure lists models like GPT-4o, o-series, and mentions pricing tiers. Again, Azure's integration but includes valid models.\n\nWeb Page 11 (Wikipedia) lists GPT family, DALL-E, Sora, etc., as OpenAI's models. Good for overview but not official.\n\nWeb Page 12 is GitHub's OpenAI Python library, showing examples with models like gpt-4o. Useful for confirming model names.\n\nWeb Page 16 from OpenAI's Agents SDK mentions models like o3-mini and GPT-4o, indicating they're official.\n\nPutting this together: The official models mentioned across sources include GPT series (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5), o-series (o1, o3-mini), GPT-4o variants, DALL-E, Whisper, and newer models like GPT-4.1 and o3-mini. The Azure page and Stack Overflow code snippets corroborate these. Since the official docs (Page 1 and 6) can't be accessed, the aggregated info from credible sources like Azure, GitHub, and the Agents SDK gives a comprehensive list. Need to present these models with their purposes and note that the official list is typically found on platform.openai.com, but the current content isn't accessible here.\n\n**Final Information**  \nThe most up-to-date list of OpenAI models, based on official and semi-official sources, includes the following categories and specific models:  \n\n---\n\n### **Core Language Models**  \n1. **GPT Series**:  \n   - **GPT-4.1**: Latest release as of 2025, supports text and image inputs, optimized for diverse tasks (e.g., chat completions, function calling).  \n   - **GPT-4.5 (Preview)**: Prior to GPT-4.1, excelled in text/image tasks but deprecated in favor of GPT-4.1.  \n   - **GPT-4**:  \n     - Base variant (e.g., `gpt-4`).  \n     - Extended context (`gpt-4-32k`).  \n     - Turbo variants (`gpt-4-turbo`, optimized for speed/cost).  \n   - **GPT-3.5**:  \n     - Base (`gpt-3.5-turbo`).  \n     - Extended context (`gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`).  \n\n2. **o-Series (Reasoning Models)**:  \n   - **o3-mini**: Advanced reasoning capabilities, improved problem-solving, and scientific tasks.  \n   - **o1 Series**: Includes `o1`, `o1-mini`, and older preview versions (e.g., `o1-preview`).  \n   - **o1-Pro**: Not accessible via the standard Chat Completions API but available via specialized plugins.  \n\n3. **GPT-4o Series (Multimodal)**:  \n   - Supports text, images, and audio.  \n     - `gpt-4o`: Full capabilities.  \n     - `gpt-4o-mini`: Lightweight version for cost-effective use.  \n     - Audio variants: `gpt-4o-audio-realtime` (low-latency speech interaction) and `gpt-4o-audio-completion` (audio generation).  \n\n---\n\n### **Specialized Models**  \n1. **DALL·E Series**:  \n   - Generates images from text prompts (e.g., `dall-e-3`).  \n\n2. **Whisper**:  \n   - Transcribes and translates speech to text (preview models like `whisper-1`).  \n\n3. **Text-to-Speech**:  \n   - Synthesizes text into speech (preview models like `tts-1`).  \n\n4. **Embeddings Models**:  \n   - Convert text to numerical vectors (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).  \n\n---\n\n### **Access and Deployment**  \n- **Official API Endpoint**: Use `platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference` to interact programmatically.  \n- **Azure Integration**: Available via Azure OpenAI Service with models like `gpt-4o`, `o-series`, and region-specific deployments.  \n- **Pricing Tiers**:  \n  - **Standard**: Pay-as-you-go.  \n  - **Provisioned**: Reserved capacity for predictable workloads.  \n  - **Batch**: Optimized for large-scale inference jobs.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes**  \n- **New Releases**:  \n  - OpenAI plans to release an \"open\" model (similar to GPT-2) in 2025 with reasoning capabilities (e.g., `o3-mini`).  \n  - Experimental models like `computer-use-preview` require explicit approval.  \n\n- **Documentation**:  \n  - Official model details are typically found at `platform.openai.com/docs/models`, but direct access was unavailable in the provided search results.  \n  - Use the API `list()` method (via Python SDK) to retrieve real-time model availability:  \n    ```python  \n    import openai  \n    client = openai.OpenAI()  \n    models = client.models.list()  \n    for model in models:  \n        print(model.id)  \n    ```  \n\n- **Deprecated Models**: Older versions (e.g., GPT-4.5) are being phased out in favor of newer releases like GPT-4.1.  \n\n--- \n\nThis list synthesizes information from Azure OpenAI Service documentation, API references, and official SDK examples, as direct access to OpenAI’s platform content was restricted.",

They are best known for developing GPT-3, a powerful LLM trained on billions of words from the Internet. GPT-3 shows how LLMs can be applied in many creative ways without needing to code. With a bit of guidance, these models can build simple apps, generate content, converse, and more. OpenAI Overview Slides: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO0JGBQp13Ts13uk8MzzDQvbIu7oDIHp9BMCW9UWv6VuHMDT6YDkZBPnAodTFyMgA?key=Y2FNeURvTzlIclNKcG9kRjFIM01OYjRMZ2l4Tll3 What does OpenAI do? OpenAI has developed several powerful AI models that are available to the public, including GPT, a natural language processing model. GPT can write coherent and convincing text, answer questions, and even generate code. Other models developed by OpenAI include DALL-E, which can generate images from textual descriptions, and Whispers which can transcribe audio files to text. They also have an embedding API that allows for converting text/documents into vector representations which are useful for adding context to prompts with larger datasets. How can I utilize OpenAI with Xano? Open AI has made their models accessible via API, meaning we can directly interact with the models using Xano. These models are mostly powered by human language text inputs which makes it extremely accessible and easy to work with. With a small amount of effort, huge results can be achieved. Getting Started To get started you can familiarize yourself with OpenAi‚Äôs API reference docs here: API Reference If you don‚Äôt know what you are looking at that‚Äôs ok we‚Äôll explain how you can use the reference and models throughout this article. OpenAI‚Äôs API Pricing Unlike ChatGPTs web app, utilizing OpenAI‚Äôs API is a paid service. You can find a full breakdown of the API pricing here: OpenAI Pricing API Cost Warning Models such as GPT-4 can be expensive. Providing GPT4 with its biggest possible input prompt (32k tokens) can cost $1.92 USD for the input processing. And then if the output is at it's maximum output size (32k tokens) it will cost $3.84 for the response totaling $5.76 USD for a single API call. Be sure to understand the costs of the model prior to using it. Authentication / Headers The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your API Keys page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests. You‚Äôll need to register for an OpenAI account if you haven‚Äôt already. Create an environment variable via the Settings section in Xano and add your OpenAI API Key. All OpenAI API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows: Copy Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY How can you do this in Xano? When adding an external API request to your function stack you will notice there is an input field for headers. Headers are an Array so in order to add something to the headers we can use the PUSH filter which adds an item to the end of an array. We need to push our Authorization string through in order to Authenticate our requests you can paste the example in. Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY However, we want to update the string to dynamically include our OpenAI API key which we stored as an environment variable. We can do this using the REPLACE filter. It will look like this: Don't forget to save your changes! Requesting organization - For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's subscription quota. ( Skip this if you are only part of one organization ).

Our customer’s words, not ours. Skeptical? Try it out , and see for yourself. Start building Build complex workflows that other tools can't . I used other tools before. I got to know the N8N and I say it properly: it is better to do everything on the n8n! Congratulations on your work, you are a star! Igor Fediczko @igordisco Thank you to the n8n community . I did the beginners course and promptly took an automation WAY beyond my skill level. Robin Tindall @robm n8n is a beast for automation. self-hosting and low-code make it a dev’s dream. if you’re not automating yet, you’re working too hard. Anderoav @Anderoav I've said it many times. But I'll say it again. n8n is the GOAT . Anything is possible with n8n. You just need some technical knowledge + imagination. I'm actually looking to start a side project. Just to have an excuse to use n8n more 😅 Maxim Poulsen @maximpoulsen It blows my mind. I was hating on no-code tools my whole life, but n8n changed everything. Made a Slack agent that can basically do everything, in half an hour. Felix Leber @felixleber I just have to say, n8n's integration with third-party services is absolutely mind-blowing . It's like having a Swiss Army knife for automation.

Needless to say I wanted to see how they worked, and this article you’re reading offered the perfect excuse to do it. I had written it just after watching OpenAI DevDay Keynote , to see if I could use their own models to transcribe, summarize, illustrate and narrate the whole thing back to me. Which apparently, I could (click that video 😳). So now, having all the models available in Azure OpenAI, I set out to update my code to support them as well. It was a pretty seamless transition (same API as OpenAI, yay!), the only frustrating bit was figuring out which model was available in which region , and which API version each  one required. The API versions were fun to debug, I’ll tell you – setting the wrong one would result in a very friendly and utterly self-explanatory NotFoundError: Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': '404', 'message': 'Resource not found'}} message. Read on to see how using both Azure OpenAI and OpenAI versions of the following models looks like: GPT-4, Whisper, Text-to-Speech, and DALL*E 3. Lessons Learned # Whisper is fun to use and works really well. It will misunderstand some of the words, but you can get around that by either prompting it, or by using GPT or good-old string.replace on the transcript. It’s also relatively cheap. Text-to-speech is impressive – the voices sound quite natural, albeit a bit monotonous. There is a “metallic” aspect to the voices, like some sort of compression artifact. It’s reasonably fast to generate, too – it took 33 seconds to generate 3 minutes of audio. It blew my mind when I noticed they breathe in at times 😱.

Generative AI explained Feature GPT-4o vs. GPT-4: How do they compare? OpenAI's GPT-4o promises improved multimodal capabilities and increased efficiency. Explore the differences between GPT-4o and its predecessor, GPT-4. Share this item with your network: By Lev Craig, Site Editor Published: 03 Feb 2025 OpenAI's GPT-4o builds on the foundation set by the company's previous models with significant updates, including enhanced multimodal capabilities and faster performance. Since OpenAI first launched ChatGPT in late 2022, the chatbot interface and its underlying models have already undergone several major changes. GPT-4o was released in May 2024 as the successor to GPT-4 , which launched in March 2023, and was followed by GPT-4o mini in July 2024. GPT-4 and GPT-4o -- that's the letter o , for omni -- are advanced generative AI models that OpenAI developed for use within the ChatGPT interface. Both models are trained to generate natural-sounding text in response to users' prompts, and they can engage in interactive, back-and-forth conversations, retaining memory and context to inform future responses. Informa TechTarget's SearchEnterpriseAI compared these products by testing the models within ChatGPT; reading informational materials and technical documentation from OpenAI; and analyzing user reviews on Reddit, tech blogs and the OpenAI developer forum. This article is part of What is GenAI? Generative AI explained Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2025 Will AI replace jobs? 17 job types that might be affected 25 of the best large language models in 2025 Differences between GPT-4o and GPT-4 In many ways, GPT-4o and GPT-4 are similar. Both are advanced OpenAI models with vision and audio capabilities and the ability to recall information and analyze uploaded documents. Each has a 128,000-token context window and a knowledge cutoff date in late 2023 -- October for GPT-4o, December for GPT-4.

High severity content is filtered. Responsible AI At Microsoft, we're committed to the advancement of AI driven by principles that put people first. Generative models such as the ones available in Azure OpenAI have significant potential benefits, but without careful design and thoughtful mitigations, such models have the potential to generate incorrect or even harmful content. Microsoft has made significant investments to help guard against abuse and unintended harm, which includes incorporating Microsoft’s principles for responsible AI use , adopting a Code of Conduct for use of the service, building content filters to support customers, and providing responsible AI information and guidance that customers should consider when using Azure OpenAI. Get started with Azure OpenAI Service To get started with Azure OpenAI Service, you need to create an Azure OpenAI Service resource in your Azure subscription. Start with the Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource guide. You can create a resource via Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. When you have an Azure OpenAI Service resource, you can deploy a model such as GPT-4o. When you have a deployed model, you can: Try out the Azure AI Foundry portal playgrounds to explore the capabilities of the models. You can also just start making API calls to the service using the REST API or SDKs. For example, you can try real-time audio and assistants in the playgrounds or via code. Note A Limited Access registration form is required to access some Azure OpenAI Service models or features. Learn more on the Azure OpenAI Limited Access page . Comparing Azure OpenAI and OpenAI Azure OpenAI Service gives customers advanced language AI with OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3, Codex, DALL-E, Whisper, and text to speech models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. Azure OpenAI co-develops the APIs with OpenAI, ensuring compatibility and a smooth transition from one to the other. With Azure OpenAI, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. Azure OpenAI offers private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering. Key concepts Prompts & completions The completions endpoint is the core component of the API service. This API provides access to the model's text-in, text-out interface. Users simply need to provide an input prompt containing the English text command, and the model generates a text completion . Here's an example of a simple prompt and completion: Prompt : \\\"\\\"\\\" count to 5 in a for loop \\\"\\\"\\\" Completion : for i in range(1, 6): print(i) Tokens Text tokens Azure OpenAI processes text by breaking it down into tokens. Tokens can be words or just chunks of characters. For example, the word “hamburger” gets broken up into the tokens “ham”, “bur” and “ger”, while a short and common word like “pear” is a single token. Many tokens start with a whitespace, for example “ hello” and “ bye”. The total number of tokens processed in a given request depends on the length of your input, output, and request parameters. The quantity of tokens being processed will also affect your response latency and throughput for the models. Image tokens Azure OpenAI's image processing capabilities with GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4 Turbo with Vision models uses image tokenization to determine the total number of tokens consumed by image inputs. The number of tokens consumed is calculated based on two main factors: the level of image detail (low or high) and the image’s dimensions. Here's how token costs are calculated: Low resolution mode Low detail allows the API to return faster responses for scenarios that don't require high image resolution analysis. The tokens consumed for low detail images are: GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo with Vision : Flat rate of 85 tokens per image \"\n}\n***Web Page 18:***\n{\n  \"id\": 18,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI Makes the GPT-4, DALL-E, Whisper, and ChatGPT Model APIs Generally Available\",\n  \"url\": \"https://synthedia.substack.com/p/openai-makes-the-gpt-4-dall-e-whisper\",\n  \"site_name\": \"synthedia.substack.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"There has been a lot of interest ... <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>4</strong>, <strong>DALL</strong>-<strong>E</strong> <strong>for</strong> image generation, <strong>Whisper</strong> <strong>for</strong> speech recognition, and <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>3</strong>.<strong>5</strong>-turbo for ChatGPT-style solutions.

Many have been able to secure access but often after long delays. Each of these APIs is now generally available for any developer to use. Removing Barriers to Adoption While it appears that OpenAI’s large language model (LLM) APIs are the most popular among developers today, the gated access to GPT-4 has surely led many to try other, more readily available proprietary and open-source options. The shift to general availability will make it easier for developers to start with OpenAI offerings and compare them directly to alternatives, including earlier GPT-3.5 OpenAI models. The restricted approach has surely had a more negative impact on DALL-E and Whisper adoption. DALL-E appears to have fallen well behind open-source versions of Stable Diffusion and Stability AI API use. The pricing and control difference with using a raw Stable Diffusion model was always going to be an incentive for some developers. However, many developers willingly pay Stability AI for API access because it is readily available and DALL-E is not. Opening DALL-E for general availability is long overdue. I suspect this may have come sooner if ChatGPT had not been such a runaway hit and consumed so many internal resource cycles. This will also pave the way for a DALL-E 3 launch (the current version is essentially DALL-E 2) with some restrictions but open access to the most mature model version. Subscribe to Synthedia. It’s free! Subscribe Whisper’s popularity also took OpenAI by surprise after its open-source release in the fall of 2022. Its capabilities led to a lot of experimentation and other companies offering hosted versions of the natural language processing (NLP) solution. Looking to capture some of the benefits of interest in the model, OpenAI announced a limited access API in March of this year, and now it is available to anyone. This could turn out to be OpenAI’s biggest revenue source outside of its LLMs and the ChatGPT service. Proprietary speech recognition translation models offered by leading cloud providers are widely used technologies. These solutions are also expensive and often inferior to Whisper in performance. \"\n}\n***Web Page 19:***\n{\n  \"id\": 19,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI (GPT-3 DALLA·E Whisper)\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.chatdaddy.tech/application/openai-gpt-3-dalla-e-whisper\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.chatdaddy.tech\",\n  \"snippet\": \"&quot;From the makers of ChatGPT the <strong>OpenAI</strong> integration <strong>for</strong> <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>3</strong> DALLA·<strong>E</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Whisper</strong>.

                "Output": "Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user wants technical documentation details for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, o-series, DALL·E, and Whisper. First, I'll look through the provided web pages to extract relevant info.\n\nStarting with the Azure OpenAI Service models page (Web Page 3), it lists various models. GPT-4.1 has a massive context window (1,047,576) and max output tokens (32,768). GPT-4.5 is noted as a preview model, replaced by GPT-4.1. The o-series includes o3-mini and o1, emphasizing reasoning with context limits. DALL·E 3 is mentioned under image generation, and Whisper handles transcription/translation. \n\nWeb Page 13 compares GPT-4o and GPT-4, highlighting multimodal capabilities and performance. GPT-4o supports audio and images, while GPT-4 is text-focused. Cost and efficiency differences are noted here too.\n\nLooking at Web Page 18, it mentions general availability of GPT-4, DALL-E, and Whisper APIs, which is important for developers. Web Page 10 and 17 from Microsoft Learn detail Azure's offerings, including regional availability and pricing models like Standard and Provisioned.\n\nWeb Page 11 provides a real-world example using Whisper and GPT-4, showing practical applications. Technical specs like token counts and API endpoints are scattered across pages like Web Page 4 (pricing details) and Web Page 14 (model endpoints).\n\nI need to ensure all key aspects are covered: model variants, parameters, use cases, API specifics, and comparisons. Also, note deprecated models (GPT-4.5) and newer ones (o3-mini). Mentioning Azure vs. OpenAI's own platform differences might be crucial for the user's article.\n\nWait, some pages couldn't be fetched (like Web Page 2 and 9), so relying on snippets. For instance, Web Page 2's snippet mentions GPT-3.5 docs, so I'll infer details from available data. The GitHub repo (Web Page 20) shows API wrappers, indicating supported models and endpoints.\n\nPutting it all together, structure the info into sections for each model group, including technical specs, capabilities, API usage examples, and key differences.

Members Online • alphamuscle1 Difference between GPT3.5 & GPT4 Education & Learning I just came across a twitter/X thread about ChatGPT today where users were discussing how “enormous” the difference is between the free 3.5 version & the paid GPT4. Quoting these comments for context: 1 “Yeah, most people's idea of \\\"AI\\\" is the free GPT 3.5, which is so sad..” 2 “Using 3.5 is like getting excited about using MS paint in windows when you have things like photoshop out there” 3 “Dial up vs gigabit broadband” Now I only use the free version because I had no idea what I’m missing on. I still don’t lol. I’m hoping if anyone here has used both versions & can shed some light on the differences & if they are indeed massive. Please mention use cases. Read more New to Reddit?

With multiple OpenAI language models to choose from, picking the right option for your organization's needs comes down to the details. Share this item with your network: By Leah Zitter, Ph.D. Published: 12 Feb 2025 With a growing number of underlying model options for OpenAI's ChatGPT, choosing the right one is a necessary first step for any AI project. Knowing the differences between GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is essential when purchasing SaaS-based generative AI tools. GPT-3.5, the refined version of GPT-3 rolled out in November 2022, is currently offered in ChatGPT's free web app version and its premium Turbo API versions. GPT-4 , released in March 2023, provides an even more advanced GPT choice for workplace tasks and comes with its own Turbo version. Turbo versions represent incremental improvements, such as lower latency and minor bug fixes. Choosing between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 means parsing out the differences in their respective features. By breaking down the two models' key differences in capabilities, accuracy and pricing, organizations can decide which OpenAI GPT model is right for them. GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4: The major differences GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are both versions of OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer model , which powers the ChatGPT app. They're currently available to the public with a range of capabilities, features and price points. This article is part of What is GenAI? Generative AI explained Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2025 Will AI replace jobs? 17 job types that might be affected 25 of the best large language models in 2025 Extended capabilities The difference in capabilities between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 indicates OpenAI's interest in advancing the features of its models to meet increasingly complex use cases across industries. GPT-3.5 GPT-3.5 has the following key capabilities: Understands and generates humanlike text using natural language comprehension and generation to complete various natural language-related tasks. Translates text from one language to another with some fluency and accuracy. Answers questions by providing relevant information, making it suitable for chatbots and virtual assistants using GPT-3.5 Turbo, which is tailored to work with the Chat Completions API. Generates concise summaries of longer text, such as documentation and reports. Generates content for various use cases and writing projects, such as emails and code. The GPT-3.5 Turbo models are upgraded versions of GPT 3.5, with more fine-tuned language comprehension and next-generation capabilities. Users can access three model variants through the GPT-3.5 Turbo API: Gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is an instruction model that provides terser and more relevant responses . It supports a 4,096-token context window . Gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 has a 16,385-token context window for faster and more efficient processing. Gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 supports a 16,385-token context window with improvements that include higher accuracy at responding in requested formats and a fix for a bug that caused a text encoding issue for non-English language function calls.

Members Online • ComfyRug Quick and dirty comparison between gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4-turbo Educational Purpose Only I'm hearing a lot about how gpt-4 has been awful recently and the current narrative is that it's because they've switched to gpt-4-turbo . I think it's worth checking out how all three perform with the same prompt, which we're lucky enough to be able to do using the API. For context, we use ChatGPT to analyse the stock market. We also use the same prompt for each model, with a temperature of 0. gpt-4 Time taken: 25.146 seconds Senti Biosciences (SNTI) is in a strategic collaboration with Celest Therapeutics, potentially expanding its reach in China. This, coupled with promising preclinical data presentations, suggests a positive outlook. However, the stock's technical indicators show a bearish trend with SMAs and EMAs below the current price of $0.85 and RSI values indicating oversold conditions. Given the broader market uncertainty reflected in SPY and QQQ overviews, caution is advised. For today's session, consider a long position if the price breaks above the recent high of $1.04 with an entry price at $1.05 (confidence: 90%). Set the first target at $1.20 (confidence: 80%) and the second at $1.35 (confidence: 70%). Place a stop loss at $0.95. gpt-3.5-turbo Time taken: 15.346 seconds SNTI, Senti Biosciences, has recently announced a strategic collaboration with Celest Therapeutics for the clinical development of SENTI-301A in China. This partnership could open up new opportunities for SNTI in the Chinese market. Additionally, SNTI has presented new preclinical data with BlueRock Therapeutics at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting, showcasing their progress and potential. These positive developments indicate momentum for SNTI, which may impact its stock price positively. Considering the broader market sentiment, SPY faces uncertainty due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and discussions of potential humanitarian ceasefires. The rare triple gap ups in the S&P 500 ETF historically suggest weakness, urging caution for investors. Mixed market performance, rising Treasury yields, Warren Buffett's cash holdings, and a short squeeze in Treasuries contribute to an environment of uncertainty an\"\n}\n***Web Page 10:***\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"ChatGPT 3.5 vs ChatGPT 4 - Key Differences to Consider\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/chatgpt-4-vs-chatgpt-3-5-key-differences/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.kommunicate.io\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Explore the key <strong>differences</strong> <strong>between</strong> ChatGPT <strong>3</strong>.<strong>5</strong> vs ChatGPT <strong>4</strong> <strong>and</strong> know about the advancements and enhancements in the latest version of OpenAI\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/KZLsfFvlubqNgo2K3gS8ideffVmhGPgd_iAqmDfuLtY/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYmI2NWNmZTUz/ZjkzNmJjNmZmMGMy/ODA5M2U3MWI3N2E1/OTQyZTJmY2UyODEy/YjUzODBjNTdiNzIx/NDhjNmU0MS93d3cu/a29tbXVuaWNhdGUu/aW8v\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.kommunicate.io\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"ChatGPT 3.5 vs ChatGPT 4 - Key Differences to Consider Home Features Book a Demo Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Blog » Generative AI » ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4 vs 4o – Key Differences to Consider Generative AI ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4 vs 4o – Key Differences to Consider By Devashish Mamgain Updated on February 11, 2025 November 30, 2022, marked a silent revolution as ChatGPT, a general-purpose chatbot, quietly emerged from the then-unknown company OpenAI. Within 5 days, it amassed 1 million users, outpacing Netflix and Twitter’s growth milestones. By February 2023, it set the record for the fastest-growing consumer app in internet history. As the world was just settling in and getting in awe of how amazing ChatGPT was, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT 4.0 in March 2023, powered by the GPT-4 engine. This new version marked a significant advancement over its predecessor, ChatGPT 3.5 typically in areas such as natural language understanding, better context retention, and more nuanced responses. In this article, we will cover the key difference between the GPT-3.5 and 4 models and also provide a comparison of OpenAI’s pricing for all models, including the newly launched ChatGPT 4o model. Also, if you are looking for a comprehensive comparison between GPT 4 Turbo, Gemini Claude 3 Opus, and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, check it out here . Alternatively, if you wish to read about OpenAI o1, click here . However, before jumping to the differences, let’s first understand what ChatGPT is and how it works – Understanding ChatGPT ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is an application designed to interact with GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an advanced language model driving generative artificial intelligence. These large language models, commonly referred to as LLMs, typically consist of several key components that work together to enable language understanding and generation tasks. Essentially, they serve as powerful engines for computers, capable of writing stories, translating languages, and providing natural responses to questions. In practical terms, ChatGPT functions as a versatile tool for engaging with GPT, the powerhouse behind its capabilities. It operates as a user-friendly interface, allowing individuals to interact with the complex process of language understanding and generation facilitated by LLMs. Through ChatGPT, users can easily input queries, prompts, or requests, generating responses across a wide spectrum of tasks, from composing stories and songs to coding complex programs and crafting marketing messages, among others.

This dramatic increase in capacity surpasses the limitations of its predecessors, offering a deeper and richer interactive experience. Despite the undisclosed specifics of the model architecture or datasets utilized for training GPT-4, its enhanced capabilities and exceptional performance set it as a formidable player in the NLP domain. The Reliability of GPT-3.5 GPT-3.5, the direct precursor to GPT-4, has its own merits and strengths. Although superseded by GPT-4, this version continues to provide robust language processing capabilities. It is pre-trained on an extensive corpus of text data and excels at tasks such as text completion, translation, and question-answering, showcasing impressive few-shot and zero-shot performance. Moreover, GPT-3.5's underlying architecture, a variant of the transformer model, has allowed it to generate highly coherent and contextually accurate text. Its adaptability to different NLP tasks, such as semantic text similarity, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, continues to be relevant, demonstrating the durability and efficacy of the GPT series. Comparing the two, while GPT-4 stands out with its multimodal features and increased capacity, GPT-3.5 maintains relevance with its robust, dependable performance across a range of NLP tasks. In the following sections, we'll examine the technical distinctions and comparative performance between these two models across multiple use-cases. Comparative Analysis: Performance Across Diverse Tasks When juxtaposing GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 across various NLP tasks, subtle yet significant differences begin to emerge. Let's examine how these models fare across different use-cases. Medical Examinations: GPT-4's Superior Performance In the context of medical examinations, GPT-4 exhibits marked superiority. For instance, in clinical trial prediction tasks, GPT-4 has demonstrated an accuracy rate of approximately 92%, outpacing GPT-3.5, which recorded an 87% accuracy rate in the same task. The enhanced multimodal functionality of GPT-4 allows it to parse and interpret both textual and graphical data in clinical reports, enhancing i\"\n}\n***Web Page 8:***\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Compare GPT-4o vs. GPT-3.5 Turbo\",\n  \"url\": \"https://context.ai/compare/gpt-4o/gpt-3-5-turbo\",\n  \"site_name\": \"context.ai\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Compare pricing, benchmarks and model attributes between <strong>GPT</strong>-4o and <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>3</strong>.<strong>5</strong> Turbo.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/ZEuo5I6O6UAoNnJEiqfCQk7cE87G0co8V17KMS6E71w/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTFhOTc2Yzcw/ZmZkYzEwNTIzNTM3/YmY1MGI5NzA0ODlm/MGQyNDM0NGE0Yjg1/NWYzZDkxZGU2OTIw/MTY1NzhmMC9jb250/ZXh0LmFpLw\",\n    \"hostname\": \"context.ai\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 9:***\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Balancing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for cost vs performance in game dev | by Andrew Brown | Chroma Golem | Medium\",\n  \"url\": \"https://medium.com/chroma-golem/balancing-gpt-3-5-and-gpt-4-for-cost-versus-performance-in-game-dev-8397022eef59\",\n  \"site_name\": \"medium.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Most generations can (and generally should) be preloaded before a player needs their output.

While GPT-3.5 is great at guaranteeing correct formatting in most cases, we’ve found that it still has the occasional syntactic error — and GPT-4, in our experience, hasn’t. When we’re generating filesystems in You Are Not Alice, we generate a whitespace-driven treemap of folders and files that looks like this: Folder: jsmith File: tasks_1023.csv File: report_0923.txt Folder: Finances File: expenses_0723.csv File: expenses_0823.csv File: reimbursements.txt File: income_statement.txt File: balance_sheet.csv File: meeting_notes_1017.txt Folder: Projects File: project_abc.txt File: project_xyz.txt File: client_presentation.csv Folder: Personal File: vacation_plans.txt File: birthday_gift_ideas.txt Folder: Friends File: messages_from_amy.txt File: lunch_with_bob.txt File: jessica_bday_party.txt File: notes.txt Folder: Email File: unread_emails.txt File: sent_emails.txt File: draft_emails.txt With this kind of format, the number of leading spaces and line prefixes are both crucial to building a properly constructed filesystem. We saw the occasional syntactic errors with GPT-3.5 (indenting by more than 1 space at a time, including empty lines, trying to add other prefixes, etc). Rather than “rerolling” the generation whenever there are parsing issues, we switched to GPT-4 and haven’t seen any syntactic errors since. #3 For speed-sensitive generations, use GPT-4 The prompt that necessitates the fastest turnaround in You Are Not Alice happens when a user tries to open a file. Rather than preloading the contents of every file on every system, we simply generate the filesystem structure for every employee and then generate the contents of files whenever the player opens them. When benchmarking our file content generation prompt on GPT-3.5 versus GPT-4, we saw GPT-4 completing outputs 4-5x faster on average. Most generations can (and generally should) be preloaded before a player needs their output. If you want to wait until a user initiates the generation, however, I recommend GPT-4 for the fastest response time. #4 Use animations or in-game events to pad generation times This might be another obvious one, but might make the difference between using GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 for you. Two examples come to mind: For file contents, we want generation to happen as fast as possible. In You Are Not Alice, we cache how long each file generation previously took and show a Windows-style loading bar to give the player a rough estimate of how long the generation will take. Before we added this animation, the game just looked broken or hung; adding it gave players the choice of whether to wait (knowing approximately how long) or to go do something else in the meantime. For conversation responses, we can get away with a longer delay on responses because we’re simulating a “real” employee getting back to your message. For this type of generation, we use animated typing indicators in the game’s chat program to give the player a signal that their message has been received and will be responded to.. eventually. Without these indicators, we’d feel more pressure to return a faster response. With them, we’re a little freer to return a slower response. #5 For generations with unbounded contexts, lean towards GPT-3.5 This is a big one: if your player can generate larger and larger context windows as they play (for example, more and more messages in a chat conversation), your biggest win on saving tokens will be switching these prompts from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5, especially if you don’t want to limit your context window. In You Are Not Alice, we use GPT-3.5 to respond to all new conversation messages. This was the biggest reduction of cost for us in OpenAI, as some longer conversations start to creep up on OpenAI’s context window limits (8K or 32K tokens for GPT-4, or 4K or 16K tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo). #6 For short generations, try GPT-3.5 with a higher temperature Before we switched the filesystem generation prompt to GPT-4 to avoid the occasional syntactic error, we experimented with doing filesystem gener\"\n}\n***Web Page 10:***\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"(PDF) GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: A Concise Showdown\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369897711_GPT-4_vs_GPT-35_A_Concise_Showdown\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.researchgate.net\",\n  \"snippet\": \"PDF | p&gt;As the echoes of ChatGPT&#x27;s remarkable success continue to permeate the AI community, its formidable successor, <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>4</strong>, has emerged, showing off a... | Find, read and cite all the research you need on ResearchGate\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/WJ25-tL-91vp8kSoF0YS7d8CZVivP1cG-EjlGvrmxOc/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjE0MDk0Yzli/MWQ3NGQ2ZTNjODVh/YWVmMDNkM2NkZWI5/NGEzNjdhMmEyY2E2/N2EzN2Y0OThlZjdi/YWU3MjkwMi93d3cu/cmVzZWFyY2hnYXRl/Lm5ldC8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.researchgate.net\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"ResearchGate - Temporarily Unavailable Access denied You do not have access to www.researchgate.net.

Ask Question Asked 1 year, 9 months ago Modified 9 months ago Viewed 4k times 5 $\\\\begingroup$ I have heard some back and forth regarding open source LLMs like Llama. I have heard that on certain benchmarks they perform close, the same or better than GPT-4, but caveats that they tend to lack the diversity and range of GPT-4, and also fail to be equivalent in ways certain benchmarks or metrics don’t capture fully. GPT-4 has about 170 trillion parameters, I believe? It seems like the biggest open source models are all in the billions - like Bloom or the new Falcon 40b . There are techniques where they refine GPT-4’s output into a smaller amount of training data that supposedly hits all the marks and does just as well; but again, I don’t know if that’s only true under the reductionist of view of a particular benchmark-questionnaire. So, do open source models actually compete with GPT-4, and why or why not? Is the whole situation a matter of scale, that a commercial venture like OpenAI can foot the massive bill of training a multi-trillion parameter model that no open source AI project can afford, on top of them having expertise in model design, making GPT-4 continually the state-of-the-art? Or is there any open source model that truly can compare in terms of usability? transformer open-ai large-language-models gpt-4 open-source Share Improve this question Follow asked Jul 9, 2023 at 8:54 Julius Hamilton Julius Hamilton 225 2 2 silver badges 10 10 bronze badges $\\\\endgroup$ 1 $\\\\begingroup$ I recently came across this article - Open Source vs Closed Source LLMs. Pros and Cons , you can learn more. $\\\\endgroup$ – Springs Commented Jan 24, 2024 at 16:57 Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 6 $\\\\begingroup$ The remarkable performance of GPT 4 is due to the massive size of its architecture and the amount of data it was trained on, which costs a lot of money.

We’re here to help you find out. We’ve put together this side-by-side comparison of both ChatGPT versions, so when you’re done reading, you’ll know what version makes the most sense for you and yours. What are GPT 3.5 and GPT-4? screenshot / Digital Trends Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are natural language models used by OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence chatbots to craft humanlike interactions. They can both respond to prompts like questions or requests, and can provide responses very similar to that of a real person. They’re both capable of passing exams that would stump most humans, including complicated legal Bar exams, and they can write in the style of any writer with publicly available work. Related OpenAI adjusts AI roadmap for better GPT-5 OpenAI plans to make Deep Research free on ChatGPT, in response to competition The delay is over — you can now generate images with ChatGPT for free But GPT-4 is the newer of the two models, so it comes with a number of upgrades and improvements that OpenAI believes are worth locking it behind a paywall — at least for now. How can you use GPT 3.5 and GPT-4? GPT-3.5 is fully available as part of ChatGPT, on the OpenAI website . You’ll need an account to log in, but it’s entirely free, and you’ll have the ability to chat with ChatGPT as much as you like, assuming the servers aren’t too busy. You can also find GPT 3.5 being used by a range of other chatbots that are widely available across different sites and services. GPT-4, on the other hand, is a little harder to come by. You can use it through the OpenAI website as part of its ChatGPT Plus subscription . It’s $20 a month, but you’ll get priority access to ChatGPT as well, so it’s never too busy to have a chat. There are some ways to use GPT-4 for free , but those sources tend to have a limited number of questions, or don’t always use GPT-4 due to limited availability.

Here are some of the biggest features and use cases to emerge so far. by Mitchell Clark and James Vincent Mar 15, 2023, 2:42 PM UTC Link Facebook Threads On Tuesday, OpenAI announced GPT-4 , its next-generation AI language model. While the company has cautioned that differences between GPT-4 and its predecessors are “subtle” in casual conversation, the system still has plenty of new capabilities. It can process images for one, and OpenAI says it’s generally better at creative tasks and problem-solving. Assessing these claims is tricky. AI models, in general, are extremely complex, and systems like GPT-4 are sprawling and multifunctional, with hidden and as-yet-unknown capabilities. Fact-checking is also a challenge. When GPT-4 confidently tells you it’s created a new chemical compound, for example, you won’t know if it’s true until you ask a few actual chemists. (Though this never stops certain bombastic claims going viral on Twitter.) As OpenAI states clearly in its technical report , GPT-4’s biggest limitation is that it “hallucinates” information (makes it up) and is often “confidently wrong in its predictions.” These caveats aside, GPT-4 is definitely technically exciting and is already being integrated into big, mainstream products. So, to get a feel for what’s new, we’ve collected some examples of its feats and abilities from news outlets, Twitter, and OpenAI itself, as well as run our own tests. Here’s what we know: It can process images alongside text As mentioned above, this is the biggest practical difference between GPT-4 and its predecessors. The system is multimodal, meaning it can pars\"\n}\n***Web Page 16:***\n{\n  \"id\": 16,\n  \"title\": \"o1 vs GPT-4.5 - Detailed Performance & Feature Comparison\",\n  \"url\": \"https://docsbot.ai/models/compare/o1/gpt-4-5\",\n  \"site_name\": \"docsbot.ai\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Discover how OpenAI&#x27;s o1 and OpenAI&#x27;s <strong>GPT</strong>-<strong>4</strong>.<strong>5</strong> <strong>stack</strong> up in <strong>performance</strong>, features, and applications.

By examining these aspects, we aim to determine whether the new model’s capabilities genuinely improve our workflows and problem-solving efficiency. OpenAI Models for Text Search (Complex Data Extraction Tasks) In this experiment, we evaluated how different models handled a prompt requiring the extraction of a specific quote from an example text. The task was to determine why the tippler was drinking, based on the text from “The Little Prince,” and include the exact quote and its page number. The original input included a PDF document with the whole book. As GPT-3.5 is not able to analyze files in such a format, we attempted to copy-paste the text, but it exceeded the allowed context window. GPT-3.5 in Text Search The model was unable to load the document. When the content was copied and pasted, an error message indicated that the context length was too big. Accuracy: – (Unable to provide a response.) GPT-4 in Text Search The model was able to load the document. Here is its response: Answer: -> The tippler was drinking to forget that he was ashamed of his drinking habit. Quote: -> \\\"So that I may forget,\\\" replied the tippler. \\\"Forget what?\\\" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him. \\\"Forget that I am ashamed,\\\" the tippler confessed, hanging his head. Page number: -> 30 Accuracy : Correctly identified the reason for drinking and provided an accurate quote. Metadata : Provided the approximate page number. GPT-4o in Text Search GPT-4o had no problem loading and analyzing the image. Here are its responses to a given prompt: Answer: -> The tippler was drinking to forget that he was ashamed of drinking.

A model is a type of prediction tool in the artificial intelligence field, typically designed for a specific kind of scenario. These models are used for anticipating a variety of outcomes - from weather patterns and stock market trends to sports results and image content identification. The common thread among these models is their ability to take a certain input (like current weather data) and output a prediction (like tomorrow's forecast), often accompanied by a confidence level. The accuracy and reliability of these predictions can vary widely. Before the advent of GPT models, there wasn't an efficient model capable of accurately predicting the continuation of a given \\\"text input\\\", there wasn't an efficient model capable of accurately predicting the continuation of a given \\\"text input\\\". However, OpenAI pioneered a new category of models known as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), which significantly improved this. These GPT models can effectively 'extend' an input text in many circumstances, matching or sometimes surpassing the speed and proficiency of an average human. Since \\\"text input\\\" is a broadly applicable concept, these GPT models can be employed for a range of tasks, from answering queries and adhering to editing/formatting guidelines to even writing code. So, in essence, a GPT model is a forecasting tool for textual content. History of the different models of OpenAI Before understanding the differences between those different models, let’s take a trip down the (short) memory lane and understand the GPT models that openAI released over the last 7 years of their existence. GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): Released in 2018, the GPT model was a breakthrough in the domain of language understanding and generation. It was pretrained on a diverse range of internet text, but it was not without its limitations, including generating creative but sometimes nonsensical responses. GPT-2: Introduced in 2019, GPT-2 was a direct upgrade to its predecessor, offering more parameters and better performance. Initially, due to concerns about potential misuse, the full model wasn't released. However, it was fully open-sourced later that year. GPT-3: The third iteration, released in 2020, increased the model capacity significantly, boasting 175 billion machine learning parameters. This model was capable of generating impressively coherent and contextually relevant responses, even outperforming its predecessors in translation, question-answering, and other tasks. GPT-3 fine-tuned variants: OpenAI also released some GPT-3 models that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. For example, the ChatGPT model (technically GPT-3.5), a version of GPT-3, was fine-tuned specifically for generating conversational responses. GPT-4, released in 2023, is the most advanced model so far with 1 Trillion parameters. In internal testing, the model managed to score within the 94th percentile on the SAT (end of high-school exam in the USA), the 88th percentile on the LSAT (Law School Admission Test), and the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam (Lawyer Exam). These results are remarkable when compared to the previous model, GPT-3.5, which achieved scores in the 82nd percentile on the SAT, the 40th percentile on the LSAT, and just the 10th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. So what are the differences Between GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 Models? Models from the GPT-3 range are designed to generate text in response to specific directives, but they aren't as effective for generating fluid, conversational responses. The peak performer in this class is text-davinci-003, though it does come with a higher price tag. At the very beginning of GPT Workspace, all of our services used text-davinci-003, which is also quite slow. The GPT-3.5 series, also known as ChatGPT, which was launched on the 1st of March, 2023, is designed with a focus on conversation. These models can also handle instructional cues quite competently, similar to text-davinci-003. However, in certain situations, they may generate responses that are somewhat more verbose or imaginative than necessary. However those are not real drawbacks since this model performs extremely well on most tasks, is also extremely fast and cheap to run. Compared to the latest release of Bard AI, the competitor of the GPT models from Google, it tends to be more logical and “hallucinates” (invents imaginary answers) way less. The GPT-4 models, is the last model of openAI, it is currently the cutting edge of the GPT models (available only for our Premium, Team members) and most likely the smartest model available on the market right now. Extremely good at reasoning it also excels in writing, inventing and deductive reasoning. OpenAI also announced multimodality (the ability to run queries via images and other types of media, not only text). It is also capable of doing mathematical calculations extremely well, one part where GPT-3.5 just was not capable. His only and biggest drawback is that it is… slow. And also expensive, so much so that OpenAI limits (at the time of writing) to even its paying customers at 25 messages every 3 hours. So which model to choose? For productivity tasks, the short answer is: GPT-3.5 Turbo. It is particularly good with everything related to Google Sheets to provide quick results and fill in cells, lists and tables quickly. However for a professional utilization and for people that don’t mind the latency, using GPT-4 will outperform it mostly everywhere. Many people are waiting for GPT-4-Turbo, but it will probably be a while before it's released. The older models like text-davinci-003 have been simply deprecated from GPT Workspace, as they were not providing the performance expected from our users. Conclusion In conclusion, OpenAI's series of GPT models have revolutionized the field of language understanding and generation. From the initial GPT model to the latest GPT-4, each iteration has brought significant improvements in terms of parameters, performance, and specific capabilities. While GPT-3 models excel in generating text in response to specific directives, the GPT-3.5 Turbo shines in tasks related to conversation and productivity. GPT-4, despite being slower and more costly, is unparalleled in its intelligence and reasoning capabilities. The choice between these models largely depends on specific use-cases and requirements. As we anticipate the release of GPT-4 Turbo, we can only imagine the advancements it will bring. Understanding the unique features and capabilities of each model can help users make informed decisions and fully leverage the power of these AI tools. We hope this article has provided you with a deeper understanding of OpenAI's GPT models and their evolution and will help you better choose a model when using GPT Workspace.

These models work together to understand language inputs and generate meaningful outputs. ChatGPT offers a user-friendly interface for working with LLMs to accomplish numerous tasks. The application includes multiple versions, which provide updated functionality, including advanced speed and better accuracy. Knowing the differences helps you identify the best choice for your task. Terms to know Here are some terms to know to better understand the details in this article: Tokens: This term represents the smallest unit into which text data can be broken down for AI to process. Depending on the text, a token may include characters, words, or phrases. A general rule of thumb for ChatGPT is that 1 token is about 4 characters in English. Context window: This term refers to the number of tokens preceding and following a specific word or character. The context window incorporates user prompts and AI responses from recent user history to make its responses more relevant. Latency: This term refers to the time it takes for the AI to process a prompt and generate a response. GPT-3.5 Turbo This version is one of the older ChatGPT models. While newer varieties exist, GPT-3.5 Turbo is still beneficial for its fast responses and inexpensive cost. It can understand and generate natural language and code. While GPT-3.5 Turbo is still a high-quality model, its main limitations come from its less recent information, smaller context window and output limit. Here’s an overview of GPT-3.5 Turbo according to a few factors: Cost: The latest version of GPT-3.5 Turbo is relatively cost-effective, with pricing of $0.50 per 1 million tokens of input and $1.50 per 1 million tokens of output. Token limits: This model has a context window of 16,385 tokens and a maximum output of 4,096 tokens. Recency of information: This model operates off of knowledge collected before September 2021. Output quality: While GPT-3.5 Turbo is less nuanced and conversational than other models, it still provides acceptable output quality. Speed: This model is faster than average, with an output of 121.5 tokens per second and a latency of 0.60 seconds. GPT-4 Turbo This model is an optimized, large-scale technology offering high intelligence for your tasks. It includes GPT-4 Vision, which makes it multimodal, accepting image and text inputs. GPT-4 Turbo delivers excellent processing power and solves complex scientific and mathematical problems. Its responses are more nuanced than earlier models, more accurate, and less prone to hallucinations. Here’s an overview of a few key details: Cost: The price is $10 per 1 million input tokens and $30 per 1 million output tokens. Token limits: The model has a context window of 128,000 tokens and an output limit of 4,096 tokens. Recency of information: GPT-4 Turbo takes its information from an enhanced selection of diverse internet sources from December 2023 and earlier. Output quality: This model serves high-demand applications, contributing knowledgeable responses to inputs and queries. Speed: This model’s added functionality slows its speed, with an output of 39.3 tokens per second and a latency of 1.25 seconds. GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini These are the latest, biggest, and best models released by OpenAI. They have high intelligence and the ability to complete complex, multistep tasks. Like GPT-4 Turbo, they include multimodal input options, such as text and images. Their data extraction, classification, and verbal reasoning capabilities are much more advanced than those of earlier ChatGPT models. See how they compare to other ChatGPT versions: Cost: GPT-4o costs $2.50 per 1 million input tokens and $10 per 1 million output tokens.

I'm Dosu , a friendly bot here to help address your queries and issues while we wait for a human maintainer. I'm here to assist with bug fixes, answer questions, and guide you toward becoming a contributor. Looking forward to our interaction! The differences you're observing between ChatOpenAI , ChatTextGen , TextGen , and OpenAI in the LangChain framework are likely due to the different ways these classes interact with language models and handle text generation. ChatOpenAI and ChatTextGen are designed to generate language model responses in a chat-like format. They are typically used when you want to have a back-and-forth conversation with the language model. On the other hand, TextGen and OpenAI are more general-purpose classes for generating text from a language model. The ChatOpenAI and ChatTextGen classes might be returning more tokens because they are designed to handle a conversation with multiple turns, and each turn can generate a significant amount of text. In contrast, TextGen and OpenAI might generate less text because they are typically used for single-turn tasks, like generating a paragraph of text from a prompt. The specific differences in token count and text length you're observing could also be due to differences in the underlying language models, the specific prompts and parameters you're using, or the way the classes handle token counting and text truncation. As for the restrictions you mentioned, the ChatOpenAI and ChatTextGen classes might impose certain restrictions to ensure the generated text is suitable for a chat-like format. For example, they might limit the length of the generated text to prevent overly long responses, or they might apply special formatting to the text to make it more readable in a chat context. I hope this helps clarify the differences between these classes. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please let me know!

In Anthropic’s words, MCP aims to replace fragmented one-off integrations with “a single protocol” , making it “simpler, more reliable” for AI systems to get the context and data they need​. Because of this broad connectivity, some observers have nicknamed MCP the “USB-C port for AI systems,” meaning it provides one universal plug to connect any language model to any dataset or tool without custom adapters​ OpenAI’s Current Position on MCP As of now (early 2025), OpenAI has not announced any official plans to adopt MCP in its models or APIs. There have been no public statements or documentation from OpenAI explicitly mentioning MCP support or integration. This topic has been raised by developers — for example, an OpenAI forum post in February 2025 asked if OpenAI would consider supporting the MCP standard to enable a unified interface across AI providers​. The question highlighted how MCP could “simplify development and integration” in multi-model environments and asked if OpenAI had any plans to support it​ community.openai.com So far, no official response or roadmap from OpenAI has confirmed MCP adoption, suggesting that no public commitment to MCP exists at this time. It’s worth noting that OpenAI has been developing its own solutions for tool integration and context expansion . For instance, OpenAI’s function calling feature (introduced mid-2023) allows third-party APIs to be called by models, and more recently OpenAI launched an Agents SDK with built-in tools (web browsing, file search, computer control) for ChatGPT and its API. These proprietary features address some of the same needs as MCP — connecting models to external functionalities — but they are OpenAI-specific and not an open standard . In other words, OpenAI’s current approach focuses on its in-house ecosystem (plugins, function calls, “Work with Apps” for the ChatGPT desktop, etc.) rather than adopting an external standard. There is speculation that OpenAI might eventually create its own version of a “context protocol” or join the standardization effort, but nothing official has been announced​ Community and Expert Discussions Despite the lack of an official stance, MCP has generated significant discussion in AI developer communities about its potential relevance to OpenAI: Developer Interest: The OpenAI developer forum thread mentioned above shows community interest in OpenAI adopting MCP​ community.openai.com Developers note that as the AI landscape becomes more multi-model (with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source, etc.), a unified protocol like MCP could make life easier. The fact that Anthropic open-sourced MCP as a neutral standard (not tied to one vendor) has been seen as a positive step toward interoperability in AI systems. Comparisons to OpenAI’s Tools: AI practitioners have compared MCP to OpenAI’s existing features. One common question is how MCP differs from OpenAI’s function calling or plugin mechanisms. Analysts note that MCP is more generalized and vendor-agnostic — it’s not limited to one model or API. For example, a Latent Space analysis argued that “MCP wins over… arguably even OpenAI function calling” by offering a more exhaustive, standardized approach to tool/data integration​ latent.space In essence, OpenAI’s function calling schema provides a way to call APIs, but MCP goes further by defining a whole protocol (with concepts like resources, tools, prompts, etc.) for maintaining context across many tools in a consistent way. Experts view MCP’s “AI-native” design as a key advantage — it was built specifically for LLMs to interact with their environment, whereas OpenAI’s solutions evolved more incrementally latent.space “Work with Apps” vs MCP: Some commentators have contrasted Anthropic’s MCP with OpenAI’s “Work with Apps” feature (part of the ChatGPT desktop app). OpenAI’s Work with Apps lets ChatGPT interface with certain local applications (like your IDE or text editor) to read or modify content, which is a step toward connecting the model with external contexts. However, this feature is platform-specific and not a broad industry standard — it’s limited to the ChatGPT Mac app and certain supported apps. In contrast, MCP is a cross-platform, open protocol intended for any application or model. While both aim to give AI more context or ability to act, MCP is a network protocol for any AI agent (cloud or local), whereas Work with Apps is a proprietary integration for a specific product.

And then we’ll able to see what the recommendation it provides. satisfice December 27, 2022,  1:26am 3 ChatGPT cannot have a philosophical discussion. It is an unreliable narrator of its own thoughts… in fact, it denies having thoughts, as such. It denies having a sense of self, yet constantly writes as if it has a sense of self. It explains that such rhetoric is a “convention.” I suppose it is, but it’s a convention that has essentially one driving purpose: deception. But it can be useful in the study of philosophy, because its answers provide a rich source of material about which to think critically. Instead of having one of my students say something half-baked and asking the other students to critique it, I can outsource the glib and fatuous rhetoric to ChatGPT. That way no one’s feelings get hurt. With some tweaks, ChatGPT might be able to operate philosophically, but it would have to be able to process a lot more tokens (I’m guessing two orders of magnitude more) and use that processing to think critically and “step-by-step” about its own “intuitions.” It would need enough memory to form a stable opinion over time, and we who interact with it would have to be able to selectively clear that opinion and force it to rethink based on specific premises. wildcatgeo December 27, 2022,  5:39pm 4 I agree that it probably needs more memory, and some kind of recursive algorithms to develop a personality and to actually hold beliefs. I’m not sure it specifically has any intentions per se, like deception, but it does just mimic conversations and try to keep them going. I don’t know if I agree that there needs to be more tokens processed, it seems to do really well already\"\n}\n***Web Page 14:***\n{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI Developer Community - Community of developers building with OpenAI.\",\n  \"url\": \"https://community.openai.com/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"community.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Connect with other developers building with the <strong>OpenAI</strong> API Platform.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/yzHAMB9BuPzMpH2keY_ZaXdvMIbzAVFe2Iwxnk71vfE/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZTQ1ZDg1YTNj/Nzc3NWJkMjg2YmQx/ZDBkYmQ2Zjk4ZTcx/NmIzZTU0MTM5OTYz/ZDViMTg2ZDRmN2Jh/NDcwMDkyMS9jb21t/dW5pdHkub3BlbmFp/LmNvbS8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"community.openai.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"OpenAI Developer Community - Community of developers building with OpenAI.

Engineering coach and CTO of Teleclinic. Contents When I began experimenting with the OpenAI API, I didn’t pause to consider the range of available models. Instead, I used what was generally regarded as the most potent model at the time, GPT-3.5. But with the announcement of GPT-4’s general availability , I decided it was time to delve further. Initially, I hadn’t planned to write this article, let alone publish it. It started with me exploring other models to understand their purpose and why they were created. Upon realizing that other developers had similar questions, I decided that this topic warranted a post. This is that post. My aim is to provide an overview of all the currently available text models and offer guidelines to assist you in choosing the best fit for your AI application. Cheatsheet with all the models discussed in this tutorial. Feel free to download the full-page image . Before delving deeper, let’s review the available GPT generations. The Three GPT Generations OpenAI has introduced three generations of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models can execute all kinds of text-processing tasks, including question-answering, translation, creative content writing, summarizing, and role-following behavior. GPT-3 is the first generation of LLMs from OpenAI (GPT-2 was never publicly released). While effective at text generation, it can get confused and make mistakes. GPT-3.5 represents a minor update to GPT-3. It is more factual and less prone to harmful outputs than GPT-3. Also, it’s faster. GPT-4 is the latest generation of LLMs from OpenAI. It significantly surpasses GPT-3 or GPT-3.5 in power, producing more coherent, accurate, and creative text. It’s also multi-modal, meaning it can process audio and images. Considerations When Selecting a Language Model When selecting the appropriate Large Language Models (LLMs) for our application, there are several factors to consider. Text Completion vs. Chat Models A completion model attempts to extend the user’s prompt with relevant text. For instance, if our prompt is “The horse is,” the model will likely respond with something like “a domesticated animal.” Completion models do not have conversational capabilities . We send a single request, receive a response, and that’s the end of the interaction. On the other hand, chat models are optimized for engaging in conversations. While they technically function as completion models, they can tell apart who said what, leading to a more natural conversation flow. We can pose questions, receive answers, and make follow-up requests. Anyone who has used ChatGPT would be familiar with this type of interaction. In the table below, you can find both completion and chat models. As illustrated, both types of models use different API endpoints .

In a post on X on Wednesday , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI will add support for Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol , or MCP, across its products, including the desktop app for ChatGPT. MCP is an open source standard that helps AI models produce better, more relevant responses to certain queries. “People love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products,” Altman said. “[It’s] available today in the Agents SDK and support for [the] ChatGPT desktop app [and] Responses API [is] coming soon!” MCP lets models draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. The protocol enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications, such as chatbots. Developers can expose data through “MCP servers” and build “MCP clients” — for instance, apps and workflows — that connect to those servers on command. In the months since Anthropic open sourced MCP, companies including Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have added MCP support for their platforms. “Excited to see the MCP love spread to OpenAI – welcome!” Anthropic chief product officer Mike Krieger said in an X post . “MCP has [become a] thriving open standard with thousands of integrations and growing. LLMs are most useful when connecting to the data you already have and software you already use.” OpenAI says it intends to share more about its MCP plans in the coming months .

My goal would be to create a more efficient conversation model for code development where gpt would be able to store more valuable information for the development that the user wants during the conversation. Whereas, after a certain number of requests and responses, gpt starts to ignore what was decided before. _j September 22, 2023, 10:49am 2 That’s a good question and one I could answer. ChatGPT , which is at chat.openai.com and the official mobile app, is designed as a consumer end product. It is ready to use for anyone with a phone number in a supported country. You can upgrade to a smarter AI and more features for $20/month subscription. OpenAI API is an Application Programming Interface. It is oriented towards developers that want to make their own products on their customer-facing portal. It can also be used by your own programs to interact with AI models. Other models are available via API besides just “Talk to an AI”, such as ones that allow searching a database, doing voice recognition, creating images. API usage is billed by the actual data use, the amount of language that goes in and comes out. What is the difference between the AI that you get at ChatGPT and the AI that can be programmed via API? The AI is essentially the same. However, ChatGPT has everything implemented to turn it into an end-user product . It can remember conversations, and lets you edit those conversations. It manages user accounts and subscriptions. It lets you give feedback for improving the language training of AI. All things a developer of API products must do themselves. Let me know what else I might be able to answer! 1 Like Related topics Topic Replies Views Activity My GPT vs OpenAI API, what's the difference?

The user started by wanting to know about OpenAI's models and their differences. They first checked the official website to list all models, then looked into technical documentation for details like parameters and use cases. When community discussions on Reddit and Stack Overflow didn't yield results, they shifted to seeking third-party benchmarks and academic analyses.\n\nNow, the latest search query is for third-party benchmarks comparing OpenAI models. The user probably wants to get independent, external evaluations of how these models perform against each other. Since the official docs and community forums didn't provide enough comparative data, they're looking for studies or analyses that might highlight real-world performance differences, accuracy, speed, or other metrics between models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, o-series, etc. \n\nThe intent here is to gather objective, data-driven comparisons that aren't directly from OpenAI's own materials. This could include benchmarking results from institutions, tech blogs, or research papers that test models on specific tasks (like NLP tasks, coding, reasoning, etc.). The user likely wants this information to make informed decisions about which model to use for particular applications, considering factors like cost, performance, and specific capabilities.\n</think>\n\n**Current Search Intent:**  \nThe user is seeking **third-party benchmarks or independent analyses** to compare the performance, capabilities, and limitations of OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, o-series, DALL·E, Whisper) based on real-world testing or academic studies.  \n\n### Key Objectives Behind This Intent:\n1. **Objective Comparisons**:  \n   - Identify **quantitative metrics** (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost per token) across models for specific tasks (e.g., text generation, coding, reasoning, multimodal processing).  \n   - Understand **weaknesses** not highlighted in official documentation (e.g., hallucination rates, context handling, latency).  \n\n2. **Use Case Validation**:  \n   - Determine which models perform best for niche applications (e.g., real-time chatbots, scientific research, creative tasks).  \n\n3. **Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs**:  \n   - Compare cost-effectiveness of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo vs. GPT-4 for different workloads.  \n\n4. **Multimodal Capabilities**:  \n   - Evaluate how GPT-4o or o3-Mini handle **text, images, and audio** compared to unimodal models.  \n\n5. **Community or Expert Insights**:  \n   - Gather **practical experiences** from developers or researchers who have tested these models in production environments.  \n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- Links to benchmark reports (e.g., from ML benchmarks like [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces), [Benchmarks.ai](https://benchmarks.ai/), or academic papers).  \n- Analysis of tasks like **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**, **coding challenges**, or **multimodal reasoning tests**.  \n- Discussions on **model limitations** (e.g., GPT-3.5’s shorter context window vs. GPT-4’s computational cost).  \n\n### Next Steps (If No Third-Party Data Found):\n- Highlight **official documentation** and API metrics as the primary source.  \n- Suggest **direct experimentation** via OpenAI’s API for tailored comparisons.  \n- Note that newer models (e.g., GPT-4.1, o3-Mini) may lack third-party analysis due to recent release dates.\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**\n***Web Page 1:***\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Comparison of AI Models across Intelligence, Performance, Price | Artificial Analysis\",\n  \"url\": \"https://artificialanalysis.ai/models\",\n  \"site_name\": \"artificialanalysis.ai\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Comparison and analysis of AI <strong>models</strong> across key performance metrics including quality, price, output speed, latency, context window &amp; others.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/0WbwtmEtmru-f9PZvFWpsEEnBzQLm9DQPY59gBsokhk/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNmMyNTUyMGU5/OTZmZjFjZTZhNTM2/ZmQ4MDdhYWJmMDY2/Yjg5ZDdlMzQzYjlk/ZDU3MzA4ZGM3NDMx/NDhjYTQzYS9hcnRp/ZmljaWFsYW5hbHlz/aXMuYWkv\",\n    \"hostname\": \"artificialanalysis.ai\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Comparison of AI Models across Intelligence, Performance, Price | Artificial Analysis Follow us on Twitter or LinkedIn to stay up to date with future analysis Menu Artificial Analysis Language Models Speech, Image & Video Models Leaderboards 🏆 Arenas About Email address Subscribe HOME LANGUAGE MODELS SPEECH, IMAGE & VIDEO MODELS Leaderboards 🏆 Arenas About Email address Subscribe Comparison of Models: Intelligence, Performance & Price Analysis Comparison and analysis of AI models across key performance metrics including quality, price, output speed, latency, context window & others.

But while this generally appears to be the case, reasoning models are also much more expensive to benchmark, making it difficult to independently verify these claims. According to data from Artificial Analysis, a third-party AI testing outfit, it costs $2,767.05 to evaluate OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model across a suite of seven popular AI benchmarks: MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond, Humanity’s Last Exam, LiveCodeBench, SciCode, AIME 2024, and MATH-500. Benchmarking Anthropic’s recent Claude 3.7 Sonnet , a “hybrid” reasoning model, on the same set of tests cost $1,485.35, while testing OpenAI’s o3-mini-high cost $344.59, per Artificial Analysis. Some reasoning models are cheaper to benchmark than others. Artificial Analysis spent $141.22 evaluating OpenAI’s o1-mini, for example. But on average, they tend to be pricey. All told, Artificial Analysis has spent roughly $5,200 evaluating around a dozen reasoning models, close to twice the amount the firm spent analyzing over 80 non-reasoning models ($2,400). OpenAI’s non-reasoning GPT-4o model, released in May 2024, cost Artificial Analysis just $108.85 to evaluate, while Claude 3.6 Sonnet — Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s non-reasoning predecessor — cost $81.41. Artificial Analysis co-founder George Cameron told TechCrunch that the organization plans to increase its benchmarking spend as more AI labs develop reasoning models. “At Artificial Analysis, we run hundreds of evaluations monthly and devote a significant budget to these,” Cameron said. “We are planning for this spend to increase as models are more frequently released.” Artificial Analysis isn’t the only outfit of its kind that’s dealing with rising AI benchmarking costs. Ross Taylor, the CEO of AI startup General Reasoning, said he recently spent $580 evaluating Claude 3.7 Sonnet on around 3,700 unique prompts. Taylor estimates a single run-through of MMLU Pro, a question set designed to benchmark a model’s language comprehension skills, would have cost more than $1,800. “We’re moving to a world where a lab reports x% on a benchmark where they spend y amount of compute, but where resources for academics are << y,” said Taylor in a recent post on X . “[N]o one is going to be able to reproduce the results.” Why are reasoning models so expensive to test? Mainly because they generate a lot of tokens. Tokens represent bits of raw text, such as the word “fantastic” split into the syllables “fan,” “tas,” and “tic.” According to Artificial Analysis, OpenAI’s o1 generated over 44 million tokens during the firm’s benchmarking tests, around eight times the amount GPT-4o generated. The vast majority of AI companies charge for model usage by the token, so you can see how this cost can add up. Modern benchmarks also tend to elicit a lot of tokens from models because they contain questions involving complex, multi-step tasks, according to Jean-Stanislas Denain, a senior researcher at Epoch AI, which develops its own model benchmarks. “[Today’s] benchmarks are more complex [even though] the number of questions per benchmark has overall decreased,” Denain told TechCrunch. “They often attempt to evaluate models’ ability to do real-world tasks, such as write and execute code, browse the internet, and use computers.” Denain added that the most expensive models have gotten more expensive per token over time. For example, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus was the priciest model when it was released in May 2024, costing $75 per million output tokens. OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 and o1-pro , both of which launched earlier this year, cost $150 per million output tokens and $600 per million output tokens, respectively. “[S]ince models have gotten better over time, it’s still true that the cost to reach a given level of performance has greatly decreased over time,” Denain said. “But if you want to evaluate the best largest models at any point in time, you’re still paying more.” Many AI labs, including OpenAI, give benchmarking organizations free or subsidized access to their models for testing purposes. But this colors the results, some experts say — even if there’s no evidence of manipulation, the mere suggestion of an AI lab’s involvement threatens to \"\n}\n***Web Page 6:***\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"Gpt4 comparison to anthropic Opus on benchmarks - Community - OpenAI Developer Community\",\n  \"url\": \"https://community.openai.com/t/gpt4-comparison-to-anthropic-opus-on-benchmarks/726147\",\n  \"site_name\": \"community.openai.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In a <strong>comparative</strong> assessment of Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4’s capabilities, Claude 3 Opus generally demonstrates superior performance across a spectrum of tasks that test for knowledge and reasoning abilities.

Codeforces Elo Score o3 currently leads the Codeforces coding test with a rating score of 2727. It significantly outperforms its predecessor, o1, which scored 1891 and DeepSeek’s latest model R1, which has a rating of 2029. This showcases its enhanced coding proficiency, making it a reliable model for tasks involving advanced algorithms and problem-solving techniques. SWE-bench Verified Benchmark o3 has put OpenAI back at the top of the SWE coding test with a score 71.7%. The next best model, DeepSeek R1, with a score of 49.2%, had just surpassed OpenAI’s o1 at 48.9%. This superior performance highlights o3’s strength in handling real-world software engineering problems, including debugging and code verification. American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) Benchmark In the AIME benchmark, o3 achieved 96.7% accuracy, outpacing other models by a wide margin. DeepSeek R1 is a distant second, scoring 79.8%, which again, had just proved to be better than OpenAI’s o1 which scored 78%. Meanwhile models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 and OpenAI’s own GPT-4o lag far behind with just 16% and 9.3%, respectively. This highlights o3’s exceptional skills in mathematical reasoning and complex problem-solving. Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA) Benchmark o3 scored 87.7% on the GPQA-Diamond Benchmark, significantly outperforming all other models, including OpenAI o1 (76.0%) and DeepSeek R1 (71.5%).

( 2288 words) Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping the future of software development, offering new possibilities in code generation, debugging, and error resolution. Recent advancements in these AI-driven tools have prompted a closer examination of their practical applications and potential impact on developer workflows. This article explores the effectiveness of LLMs in software development, with a particular focus on error resolution . Drawing from industry-wide observations and insights gained through my work with AI Error Resolution at Raygun, I’ll analyze LLMs’ current capabilities and their implications for the future of development practices. The discussion will weigh both the promising advancements and the challenges that arise as these technologies integrate into our daily work. OpenAI models for software development OpenAI has successfully released newer, faster, and allegedly smarter models. While benchmark sites confirm these results, we see more and more anecdotal data claiming that these models feel dumber . Most existing benchmarks focus purely on the logical reasoning side of these models, such as completing SAT questions, rather than focusing on qualitative responses, especially in the software engineering domain. My goal here is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate these models using error resolution as a benchmark, given its common use in developers’ workflows. Our comprehensive evaluation will cover several models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o mini. We’ll use real-life stack traces and associated information sent to Raygun to assess how these models handle error resolution. Factors such as response speed, quality of answers, and developer preferences will be thoroughly examined. This analysis will lead to suggestions for extracting the best responses from these models, such as the impact of providing more context, like source maps and source code, on their effectiveness. Experimental methodology As mentioned, we will evaluate the following models: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o Mini.

Depending on the text, a token may include characters, words, or phrases. A general rule of thumb for ChatGPT is that 1 token is about 4 characters in English. Context window: This term refers to the number of tokens preceding and following a specific word or character. The context window incorporates user prompts and AI responses from recent user history to make its responses more relevant. Latency: This term refers to the time it takes for the AI to process a prompt and generate a response. GPT-3.5 Turbo This version is one of the older ChatGPT models. While newer varieties exist, GPT-3.5 Turbo is still beneficial for its fast responses and inexpensive cost. It can understand and generate natural language and code. While GPT-3.5 Turbo is still a high-quality model, its main limitations come from its less recent information, smaller context window and output limit. Here’s an overview of GPT-3.5 Turbo according to a few factors: Cost: The latest version of GPT-3.5 Turbo is relatively cost-effective, with pricing of $0.50 per 1 million tokens of input and $1.50 per 1 million tokens of output. Token limits: This model has a context window of 16,385 tokens and a maximum output of 4,096 tokens. Recency of information: This model operates off of knowledge collected before September 2021. Output quality: While GPT-3.5 Turbo is less nuanced and conversational than other models, it still provides acceptable output quality. Speed: This model is faster than average, with an output of 121.5 tokens per second and a latency of 0.60 seconds. GPT-4 Turbo This model is an optimized, large-scale technology offering high intelligence for your tasks. It includes GPT-4 Vision, which makes it multimodal, accepting image and text inputs. GPT-4 Turbo delivers excellent processing power and solves complex scientific and mathematical problems. Its responses are more nuanced than earlier models, more accurate, and less prone to hallucinations. Here’s an overview of a few key details: Cost: The price is $10 per 1 million input tokens and $30 per 1 million output tokens. Token limits: The model has a context window of 128,000 tokens and an output limit of 4,096 tokens. Recency of information: GPT-4 Turbo takes its information from an enhanced selection of diverse internet sources from December 2023 and earlier. Output quality: This model serves high-demand applications, contributing knowledgeable responses to inputs and queries. Speed: This model’s added functionality slows its speed, with an output of 39.3 tokens per second and a latency of 1.25 seconds. GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini These are the latest, biggest, and best models released by OpenAI. They have high intelligence and the ability to complete complex, multistep tasks. Like GPT-4 Turbo, they include multimodal input options, such as text and images. Their data extraction, classification, and verbal reasoning capabilities are much more advanced than those of earlier ChatGPT models. See how they compare to other ChatGPT versions: Cost: GPT-4o costs $2.50 per 1 million input tokens and $10 per 1 million output tokens.

Anita Kirkovska Akash Sharma Share Post Get Link Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Authors: Anita Kirkovska Akash Sharma Headline On September 12th, OpenAI announced that they‚Äôve reached a new level of AI capability and shipped the OpenAI o1 preview and OpenAI o1 mini models. Built to handle hard problems ‚Äî they take more time to think before responding, similar to how a person would approach a difficult task. The ‚Äú OpenAI o1 preview ‚Äù model, specifically, shows incredible results for various hard problems: math, coding, and reasoning. When the first o1-preview model launched, we shared a few takeaways: it wasn‚Äôt production-ready, paying for hidden tokens was tricky, and it didn‚Äôt fit well with many common use cases. Today, OpenAI released the full version of the o1 model, making it production-ready for a wide range of use cases. In this article, we‚Äôll compare its capabilities with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to see if it lives up to the claim. Results We compared these models across three key tasks: Reasoning riddles, Math Problems, and Classifying customer tickets Along the way, we explored the latest benchmarks, evaluated input and output token costs, assessed latency and throughput, and shared guidance on choosing the best model for your needs. For up-to-date rankings, check our leaderboard , or keep reading to see the results of our evaluation. From this analysis we learn that: Production apps: For apps in productions, we still recommend sing GPT-4o over o1, at least for one-off tasks like the ones we tested here. Reasoning riddles: OpenAI o1 showed some inconsistency, refusing to answer one question and scoring 60% accuracy, similar to GPT-4o, though the difference isn‚Äôt major. GPT-4o is a great model for this task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored a lower accuracy of 56%. Math equations: GPT-4o and the o1 model performed equally well on this task, raising questions about whether the higher cost of o1 is justified.

I get that things don’t always go smoothly. I am back here again while I am waiting on ChatGPT-4o to complete. It’s been a while and it is stuck with a symbol that seems to indicate it believes it is continuing to work, but the output remains stuck where it was about ten minutes ago. I am on the paid plan, though it shouldn’t make a difference I would think as to fundamental ‘workingness’. If it’s a load issue, then the system should indicate that there will be a delay. Also, since it seems entirely with no hope of coming back, I am stuck finally stopping and trying again. From my experience thus far I have to start a new session.

Learn More On the ninth day of its holiday-themed stretch of product announcements known as “12 Days of OpenAI,” OpenAI is rolling out its most advanced model, o1, to third-party developers through its application programming interface (API). This marks a major step forward for devs looking to build new advanced AI applications or integrate the most advanced OpenAI tech into their existing apps and workflows, be they enterprise or consumer-facing. If you aren’t yet acquainted with OpenAI’s o1 series, here’s the rundown: It was announced back in September 2024, the first in a new “family” of models from the ChatGPT company, moving beyond the large language models (LLMs) of the GPT-family series and offering “reasoning” capabilities. Basically, the o1 family of models — o1 and o1 mini — take longer to respond to a user’s prompts with answers, but check themselves while they are formulating an answer to see if they’re correct and avoid hallucinations. At the time, OpenAI said o1 could handle more complex, PhD-level problems — something borne out by real world users, as well . While developers previously had access to a preview version of o1 on top of which they could build their own apps — say, a PhD advisor or lab assistant — the production-ready release of the full o1 model through the API brings improved performance, lower latency, and new features that make it easier to integrate into real-world applications. OpenAI had already made o1 available to consumers through its ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans roughly two and a half weeks ago , and added the capability for the models to analyze and respond to imagery and files uploaded by users, too. Alongside today’s launch, OpenAI announced significant updates to its Realtime API, along with price reductions and a new fine-tuning method that gives developers greater control over their models. The full o1 model is now available to developers through OpenAI’s API The new o1 model, available as o1-2024-12-17, is designed to excel at complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Compared to the earlier o1-preview version, this release improves accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility. OpenAI reports significant gains across a range of benchmarks, including coding, mathematics, and visual reasoning tasks. For example, coding results on SWE-bench Verified increased from 41.3 to 48.9, while performance on the math-focused AIME test jumped from 42 to 79.2. These improvements make o1 well-\"\n}\n***Web Page 15:***\n{\n  \"id\": 15,\n  \"title\": \"OpenAI details o3 reasoning model with record-breaking benchmark scores - SiliconANGLE\",\n  \"url\": \"https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/20/openai-details-o3-reasoning-model-record-breaking-benchmark-scores/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"siliconangle.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"<strong>OpenAI</strong> also released its Sora video generator and a bevy of smaller product updates.

The model’s introduction caps off a 12-day product announcement series that started with the launch of a new ChatGPT plan. ChatGPT Pro, as the $200 per month subscription is called, features a predecessor of the new o3 LLM. OpenAI also released its Sora video generator and a bevy of smaller product updates. The company has not detailed how o3 works or when it might become available to customers. However, it did release results from a series of benchmarks that evaluated how well o3 performs various reasoning tasks. Compared with earlier LLMs, the model demonstrated significant improvements across the board. Perhaps the most notable of the benchmarks that OpenAI used is called ARC-AGI-1. It tests how well a neural network performs tasks that it was not specifically trained to perform. This kind of versatility is seen as a key requisite to creating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical future AI that can perform many tasks with the same accuracy as humans. Using a relatively limited amount of computing power, o3 scored 75.7% on ARC-AGI-1. That percentage grew to 87.5% when the model was given access to more infrastructure. GPT-3, the LLM that powered the original version of ChatGPT, scored 0%, while the GPT-4o model released earlier this year managed 5%. “Passing ARC-AGI does not equate to achieving AGI, and, as a matter of fact, I don’t think o3 is AGI yet,” François Chollet, the developer of the benchmark, wrote in a blog post . “You’ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.” OpenAI says that o3 also achieved record-breaking performance in the Frontier Math test, one of the most difficult AI evaluation benchmarks on the market. It comprises several hundred advanced mathematical problems that were created with input from more than 60 mathematicians. OpenAI says that o3 solved 25.2% of the problems in the test, easily topping the previous high score of about 2%. Programming is another use case to which the LLM can be applied. According to OpenAI, o3 outperformed the previous-generation o1 model on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark by 22.8%. The  benchmark includes questions that challenge AI models to find and fix a bug in a code repository based on a natural language description of the problem. OpenAI detailed that 3o is available in two flavors: a full-featured edition called simply o3 and o3-mini. The latter release is presumably a lightweight version that trades off so\"\n}\n***Web Page 16:***\n{\n  \"id\": 16,\n  \"title\": \"BERT vs GPT: Comparing the Two Most Popular Language Models\",\n  \"url\": \"https://blog.invgate.com/gpt-3-vs-bert\",\n  \"site_name\": \"blog.invgate.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Two language <strong>models</strong>, two ways of powering AI content.

As AI models evolve and grow increasingly sophisticated, it becomes crucial to have standardized methods to compare their performance and capabilities. AI benchmarks serve as the “exams” that measure everything from language understanding and image recognition to advanced reasoning and safety. In this guide, we explore the evolution of these benchmarks, explain how they are built and used, and provide a comprehensive comparison of current state-of-the-art models. Understanding AI Benchmarks What Are They? Imagine an exam designed not for students but for AI models. AI benchmarks are structured evaluations comprising carefully curated tasks and datasets that measure a model’s ability to: Accurately predict outcomes or classify data Efficiently process information with minimal latency Robustly handle unexpected or adversarial inputs Generalize well to new, unseen data These metrics are quantified through standardized tasks that form the foundation of AI evaluation. The Evolution of AI Benchmarks Early Days Early benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU and MNIST, provided basic performance metrics. With deep learning’s rise, tests evolved from simple image recognition tasks to complex evaluations that require models to learn and generalize from vast amounts of data. This evolution pushed the need for benchmarks that capture the multifaceted abilities of modern AI systems. Milestone Benchmarks Today Below is an overview of some of the key modern benchmarks: GLUE / SuperGLUE Domain : Natural Language Processing GLUE was among the first comprehensive benchmarks for language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question answering. Its successor, SuperGLUE, was developed as models reached human-level performance on GLUE, incorporating more challenging tasks like coreference resolution and multi-hop reasoning. Key Metrics: Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. F1 Score: Balancing precision and recall.

Months later, the results have been revised, and they now look slightly less impressive than they did initially. Last week, the Arc Prize Foundation, which maintains and administers ARC-AGI, updated its approximate computing costs for o3. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, cost around $3,000 to solve a single ARC-AGI problem. Now the Arc Prize Foundation thinks that the cost is much higher — possibly around $30,000 per task . The revision is notable because it illustrates just how expensive today’s most sophisticated AI models may end up being for certain tasks, at least early on. OpenAI has yet to price o3 — or release it, even. But the Arc Prize Foundation believes OpenAI’s o1-pro model pricing is a reasonable proxy. For context, o1-pro is OpenAI’s most expensive model to date. “We believe o1-pro is a closer comparison of true o3 cost … due to amount of test-time compute used,” Mike Knoop, one of the co-founders of the Arc Prize Foundation, told TechCrunch. “But this is still a proxy, and we’ve kept o3 labeled as preview on our leaderboard to reflect the uncertainty until official pricing is announced.” A high price for o3 high wouldn’t be out of the question, given the amount of computing resources the model reportedly uses. According to the Arc Prize Foundation, o3 high used 172x more computing than o3 low, the lowest-computing configuration of o3, to tackle ARC-AGI. Moreover, rumors have been flying for quite some time about pricey plans OpenAI is considering introducing for enterprise customers. In early March, The Information reported that the company may be planning to charge up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI “agents,” like a software developer agent. Some might argue that even OpenAI’s priciest models will cost well under what a typical human contractor or staffer would command. But as AI researcher Toby Ord pointed out in a post on X , the models may not be as efficient. For example, o3 high needed 1,024 attempts at each task in ARC-AGI to achieve its best score.
