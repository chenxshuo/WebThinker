Question: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

# Optimal Strategy for Minimum Guaranteed Winnings in a 30-Coin Game Show with Adversarial Distribution Constraints  

## Introduction  
Bob is faced with a strategic guessing game in a high-stakes game show scenario. The host distributes 30 coins into three sealed boxes, adhering to two critical constraints:  
1. **At least one box contains at least 2 coins.**  
2. **One box contains exactly 6 more coins than another box.**  

Bob must submit three numerical guesses—one for each box—without knowing the actual distribution. The rules for earning coins are strict:  
- If a guess is **less than or equal to** the actual number of coins in a box, Bob wins the **exact amount of his guess** (in thousands of dollars).  
- If a guess exceeds the actual count, Bob earns **nothing** for that box.  

The challenge lies in crafting guesses that maximize Bob’s **minimum guaranteed earnings**, assuming the host arranges the coins adversarially to minimize Bob’s payout.

## Problem Analysis  

### Enumeration of Valid Distributions  
To form valid distributions, we start by noting that one box must have exactly 6 more coins than another. Let’s denote the smaller of these two boxes as containing \( m \) coins. The larger box then contains \( m + 6 \) coins. The third box’s coin count is determined by the total of 30 coins:  
\[
\text{Third box} = 30 - m - (m + 6) = 24 - 2m  
\]  
This gives the triplet \( (m, m + 6, 24 - 2m) \). To ensure all values are non-negative:  
1. \( m \geq 0 \)  
2. \( 24 - 2m \geq 0 \Rightarrow m \leq 12 \)  

Thus, \( m \) ranges from 0 to 12, yielding **13 distinct multisets** when sorted. Each \( m \) value corresponds to a unique multiset, as shown in the table below.  

#### Example Distributions:  
| \( m \) | Sorted Multiset          | Example Permutations (Ordered Triples) | Constraint Check |  
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|  
| 0      | \( \{0, 6, 24\} \)       | (0, 6, 24)                             | 6 = 0 + 6; 24 ≥ 2 |  
| 1      | \( \{1, 7, 22\} \)       | (1, 7, 22)                             | 7 = 1 + 6; 22 ≥ 2 |  
| 2      | \( \{2, 8, 20\} \)       | (2, 8, 20)                             | 8 = 2 + 6; 20 ≥ 2 |  
| 3      | \( \{3, 9, 18\} \)       | (3, 9, 18)                             | 9 = 3 + 6; 18 ≥ 2 |  
| 4      | \( \{4, 10, 16\} \)      | (4, 10, 16)                            | 10 = 4 + 6; 16 ≥ 2 |  
| 5      | \( \{5, 11, 14\} \)      | (5, 11, 14)                            | 11 = 5 + 6; 14 ≥ 2 |  
| 6      | \( \{6, 12, 12\} \)      | (6, 12, 12)                            | 12 = 6 + 6; 12 ≥ 2 |  
| 7      | \( \{7, 13, 10\} \)      | (7, 13, 10)                            | 13 = 7 + 6; 10 ≥ 2 |  
| 8      | \( \{8, 14, 8\} \)       | (8, 14, 8)                             | 14 = 8 + 6; 8 ≥ 2 |  
| 9      | \( \{9, 15, 6\} \)       | (9, 15, 6)                             | 15 = 9 + 6; 6 ≥ 2 |  
| 10     | \( \{10, 16, 4\} \)      | (10, 16, 4)                            | 16 = 10 + 6; 4 ≥ 2 |  
| 11     | \( \{11, 17, 2\} \)      | (11, 17, 2)                            | 17 = 11 + 6; 2 ≥ 2 |  
| 12     | \( \{12, 18, 0\} \)      | (12, 18, 0)                            | 18 = 12 + 6; 0 < 2 → **Invalid** |  

The \( m = 12 \) case is invalid because the third box contains 0 coins, violating the "at least one box has ≥2 coins" constraint. Thus, there are **12 valid distributions**.

## Optimal Strategy Derivation  

### Optimal Guesses and Minimum Payout  
The optimal strategy guarantees a **minimum payout of 12 coins**, achieved by the guesses \( (6, 12, 12) \). This is derived by ensuring that, regardless of the host’s distribution, at least one guess will always land on a box with sufficient coins to meet this threshold.  

#### Example Calculation for \( (6, 12, 12) \):  
- **Distribution \( (5, 11, 14) \):**  
  - \( 6 \leq 5 \)? No → 0  
  - \( 12 \leq 11 \)? No → 0  
  - \( 12 \leq 14 \)? Yes → 12  
  - **Total payout:** 12  

- **Distribution \( (6, 12, 12) \):**  
  - \( 6 \leq 6 \)? Yes → 6  
  - \( 12 \leq 12 \)? Yes → 12  
  - \( 12 \leq 12 \)? Yes → 12  
  - **Total payout:** 30  

### Why Other Guesses Are Suboptimal  
#### Case 1: Guess \( (7, 9, 14) \)  
- **Host’s adversarial distribution:** \( (6, 12, 12) \).  
  - \( 7 \leq 6 \)? No → 0  
  - \( 9 \leq 12 \)? Yes → 9  
  - \( 14 \leq 12 \)? No → 0  
  - **Total payout:** 9 (worse than the optimal’s 12).  

#### Case 2: Guess \( (5, 11, 14) \)  
- **Host’s adversarial distribution:** \( (6, 12, 12) \).  
  - \( 5 \leq 6 \)? Yes → 5  
  - \( 11 \leq 12 \)? Yes → 11  
  - \( 14 \leq 12 \)? No → 0  
  - **Total payout:** 16 (better than 12, but vulnerable to distributions like \( (4, 10, 16) \)):  
    - \( 5 \leq 4 \)? No → 0  
    - \( 11 \leq 10 \)? No → 0  
    - \( 14 \leq 16 \)? Yes → 14  
    - **Total payout:** 14 (still better than 12, but the optimal strategy’s guarantee is more robust).

## Broader Implications of the Minimax Principle  
The problem reflects real-world decision-making under uncertainty, where the **minimax principle** (choosing the strategy that maximizes the minimum possible outcome) is critical. Here, Bob’s optimal guesses balance **risk and reward**:  
- **Risk:** Overestimating a box’s coins risks earning nothing for that guess.  
- **Reward:** Underestimating guarantees a payout but limits potential gains.  

The adversarial nature of the host mirrors scenarios like financial investments, where external factors (e.g., market volatility) can minimize returns. The minimax strategy ensures Bob avoids catastrophic losses while securing a baseline return, even in the worst-case scenario. This principle is foundational in game theory, economics, and robust decision-making frameworks.

## Conclusion  
By analyzing valid distributions and applying the minimax principle, Bob can guarantee a minimum payout of 12 coins. The analysis underscores the importance of strategic thinking in adversarial environments, where balancing risk and reward is essential for success.
