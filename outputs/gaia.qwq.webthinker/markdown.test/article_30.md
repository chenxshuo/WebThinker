### Detailed Explanation:

| *Tidal*        | 1996         | **B+**                 | Fiona Apple’s debut album, praised for its mature songwriting and emotional depth. |  
| *Extra Freaky Good* | 1997     | N/A                    | An EP (Extended Play), not a full-length studio album. Excluded from consideration. |

### Conclusion  
The albums without a Robert Christgau letter grade, listed alphabetically:  
Harbinger  
Okay, I need to write the Conclusion section based on the provided information. The user wants a comprehensive conclusion that clearly states which albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole released before 1999 didn't get a Robert Christgau letter grade. The answer is "Harbinger" by Paula Cole. 

First, I should start by restating the main point: the only album without a Christgau grade is Harbinger. Then, I need to break down the evidence for both artists. 

For Fiona Apple, her 1996 album Tidal received a B+ from Christgau. I should mention that and note she had no other pre-1999 albums except an EP, which isn't considered here. 

For Paula Cole, her two pre-1999 albums are Harbinger (1994) and This Fire (1996). This Fire got a C+, but Harbinger didn't have a grade. I need to explain that Christgau didn't review Harbinger, based on the searches done. 

I should structure this with clear sections for each artist, maybe using bullet points or a table. The user mentioned using tables if possible, so a table comparing the albums and their grades would be good. 

Wait, the user said to avoid citations, so the table can just list the albums, years, and grades. 

Also, the final answer needs to be a comma-separated list, so I'll put that at the end. 

Let me check the previous sections to ensure consistency. The key points are:

- Fiona's Tidal (1996) has a B+.
- Paula's This Fire (1996) has a C+.
- Paula's Harbinger (1994) has no grade.

So the conclusion should clearly state that only Harbinger didn't get a grade. 

I should also mention that the EP by Fiona isn't counted as an album. 

Putting it all together with a table for clarity. Maybe two tables: one for each artist. Or a single table comparing all albums. Let me see.

Alternatively, a table with columns: Artist, Album, Release Year, Christgau Grade. That would make it clear. 

Yes, that's better. Then, in the text, explain the findings based on the table. 

Then, the final answer is just "Harbinger" in a list. 

I need to make sure the conclusion is comprehensive, so each point is explained well. Also, check for any possible mistakes, like mixing up album names. Paula's first album is Harbinger, then This Fire. Fiona's only pre-1999 album is Tidal. 

Alright, time to structure this properly with the table and explanations.

## Conclusion  

The analysis of pre-1999 albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole reveals that only **Harbinger** (Paula Cole, 1994) did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence:  

### Fiona Apple’s Pre-1999 Discography  
| Album       | Release Year | Christgau Grade |  
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|  
| *Tidal*     | 1996         | **B+**          |  

Fiona Apple’s sole studio album prior to 1999, *Tidal*, was critically acclaimed and explicitly reviewed by Christgau, who awarded it a **B+**. While she released the EP *Extra Freaky Good* in 1997, this shorter release is not classified as a full-length studio album and thus excluded from consideration.  

### Paula Cole’s Pre-1999 Discography  
| Album         | Release Year | Christgau Grade |  
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|  
| *Harbinger*   | 1994         | **No Grade**    |  
| *This Fire*   | 1996         | **C+**          |  

Paula Cole released two studio albums before 1999. Her debut, *Harbinger* (1994), lacked a Christgau review or grade in archival records. In contrast, her 1996 major-label release *This Fire* received a **C+** from Christgau, confirming his engagement with her later work.  

### Final Analysis  
The absence of a Christgau grade for *Harbinger* aligns with its limited commercial visibility at the time. Released independently in 1994, the album struggled due to its label’s collapse and Paula Cole’s subsequent obscurity until *This Fire*’s success in 1996. Christgau’s critical focus on *This Fire* (1996) but not *Harbinger* underscores the latter’s marginalization in mainstream discourse prior to 1999.  

### Final Answer (Alphabetical Order)  
**Harbinger**  

This conclusion definitively resolves the query: among pre-1999 albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole, only *Harbinger* did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau.


Okay, let me tackle this conclusion section. The user wants a comprehensive conclusion based on the provided information. The main point is to determine which albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999 didn't get a Robert Christgau letter grade. From the previous analysis, the answer is "Harbinger" by Paula Cole. 

First, I need to structure the conclusion clearly. Start by stating the conclusion upfront. Then break down each artist's pre-1999 albums and their Christgau reviews. 

For Fiona Apple, her only album before 1999 is "Tidal" from 1996, which got a B+. The EP "Extra Freaky Good" in 1997 isn't a full album, so it's excluded. That's straightforward.

Paula Cole has two pre-1999 albums: "Harbinger" (1994) and "This Fire" (1996). The key here is that "Harbinger" didn't get a grade, while "This Fire" did (C+). Need to make sure that's clear. 

I should present this in a table for clarity, as the user mentioned using tables if possible. The table can list each artist, their albums, release years, and Christgau's grade or note if none. 

Then, summarize why "Harbinger" is the only one without a grade. Emphasize the alphabetical order as required. 

Avoid mentioning citations since the user said not to include them. Keep the language clear and concise but thorough. Make sure the final answer is highlighted as a comma-separated list at the end. 

Wait, the user's example had the final answer in bold, so maybe do that. Also, check if any other albums might have been missed. From the search results, Paula's "Harbinger" is the only one without a grade. Fiona's Tidal is covered. 

Double-check the years and grades. Fiona's Tidal 1996, B+. Paula's This Fire 1996, C+. Harbinger 1994, no grade. 

Okay, structure the table with Artist, Album, Release Year, Christgau Grade. Then explain each point. Conclude with the final answer. That should cover it.

## Conclusion  

The albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole prior to 1999 that did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau are **Harbinger** (Paula Cole, 1994). This conclusion is supported by an analysis of their pre-1999 discographies and Christgau’s documented reviews:  

### Breakdown by Artist  
| **Artist**       | **Album**          | **Release Year** | **Christgau Grade** |  
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|  
| **Fiona Apple**   | *Tidal*            | 1996             | **B+**              |  
|                   | *Extra Freaky Good*| 1997             | N/A (EP, not a full-length album) |  
| **Paula Cole**    | *Harbinger*        | 1994             | **No Grade**        |  
|                   | *This Fire*        | 1996             | **C+**              |  

### Key Findings  
1. **Fiona Apple’s Pre-1999 Work**:  
   - Her debut album, *Tidal* (1996), was critically acclaimed and received a **B+** from Christgau. This album established her as a prominent figure in alternative and art pop.  
   - Her 1997 EP, *Extra Freaky Good*, while released before 1999, is excluded from consideration as it is not a full-length studio album.  

2. **Paula Cole’s Pre-1999 Work**:  
   - *Harbinger* (1994), her debut album, garnered limited mainstream attention due to her label’s financial struggles. No evidence of a Christgau review or grade exists for this release.  
   - Her follow-up, *This Fire* (1996), achieved commercial success and was explicitly reviewed by Christgau, who assigned it a **C+**.  

### Final Determination  
The only album by either artist released before 1999 that lacks a Robert Christgau letter grade is **Harbinger**. This conclusion accounts for both artists’ full-length studio albums and adheres to alphabetical ordering.  

**Final Answer (comma-delimited list):**  
Harbinger


Okay, let me tackle this conclusion section. The user wants a comprehensive conclusion based on the provided information. The main point is to list the albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole released before 1999 that didn't get a Robert Christgau grade. From the previous analysis, the only one is Paula Cole's "Harbinger." 

First, I need to structure the conclusion clearly. Start by stating the conclusion upfront. Then break down each artist's discography before 1999, mention their albums, and note which ones were graded by Christgau. 

For Fiona Apple, her 1996 album "Tidal" got a B+, so that's covered. She had an EP in 1997, but EPs aren't considered full albums here. 

Paula Cole has two pre-1999 albums: "Harbinger" from 1994 and "This Fire" from 1996. "This Fire" got a C+, but "Harbinger" didn't have a grade. Need to explain that. 

I should present this in a table for clarity. Maybe two tables: one for each artist, showing their albums, release years, and Christgau's grades. That way, the information is structured and easy to compare. 

Wait, the user mentioned using markdown tables if possible. Let me create a table for each artist. 

Fiona Apple's table would have "Tidal" with B+, and note the EP separately but mention it's excluded. 

Paula Cole's table includes both albums, showing "Harbinger" without a grade and "This Fire" with C+. 

Then, summarize the findings, reiterating that only "Harbinger" is ungraded. Finally, list the answer as a comma-separated list alphabetically. 

Make sure the paragraphs are comprehensive but concise. Avoid repeating too much. Check that all key points are covered: the albums, their grades, and the conclusion. 

Also, ensure the tables are correctly formatted with headers and aligned. Maybe bold the album titles and grades for emphasis. 

Double-check that there are no other albums I missed. The user's previous analysis confirmed only "Harbinger" fits the criteria. 

Alright, putting it all together now.

## Conclusion  

The albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole prior to 1999 that did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau are **Harbinger** (Paula Cole, 1994). This conclusion is supported by an analysis of their pre-1999 discographies and Christgau’s critical reviews:  

### Fiona Apple’s Pre-1999 Discography  
| Album          | Release Year | Christgau Grade | Notes                                                                 |  
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| *Tidal*        | 1996         | **B+**          | Christgau praised its maturity and emotional depth, though later critiqued its "determinedly bathetic" tone. |  
| *Extra Freaky Good* | 1997   | N/A             | An EP excluded from consideration as it is not a full-length studio album. |  

Fiona Apple’s sole studio album before 1999, *Tidal*, received a **B+** from Christgau. Her 1997 EP *Extra Freaky Good* is not classified as a full-length album and thus does not qualify for this analysis.  

### Paula Cole’s Pre-1999 Discography  
| Album          | Release Year | Christgau Grade | Notes                                                                 |  
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| *Harbinger*    | 1994         | **No Grade**    | Christgau’s archives show no review or letter grade for this debut album. |  
| *This Fire*    | 1996         | **C+**          | Explicitly reviewed by Christgau, who critiqued its commercial leanings. |  

Paula Cole released two studio albums before 1999. While *This Fire* (1996) received a **C+**, her debut album *Harbinger* (1994) lacks any recorded Christgau review or grade. This omission suggests the album may have been overlooked by Christgau’s *Consumer Guide* or fell outside his typical coverage criteria.  

### Final Analysis  
The discrepancy arises from Christgau’s documented reviews for *Tidal* and *This Fire*, paired with the absence of any mention of *Harbinger* in his archives. Given the focus on **studio albums** (excluding EPs), only Paula Cole’s *Harbinger* meets the criteria of being a pre-1999 release without a Christgau letter grade.  

### Final Answer (Alphabetical Order)  
Harbinger
