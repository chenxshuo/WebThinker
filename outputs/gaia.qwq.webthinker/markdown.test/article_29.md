Question: In Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?

# The 'Fluffy' Dragon Debate: Stein, Blount, and the Mythic Erosion of Dragons in Children's Literature, as Explored in Emily Midkiff's *Fafnir* Article  

## Introduction  
The dragon Fafnir, a central figure in Norse mythology, embodies the archetypal guardian of treasure and terror. As the son of Hreidmar who transformed into a dragon to hoard cursed gold, Fafnir’s legacy as a symbol of primal fear and duality resonates through literature and cultural memory. Emily Midkiff’s 2014 article in the journal *Fafnir* interrogates the evolution of dragons in children’s literature, focusing on the tension between their mythic origins and modern depictions. Central to this debate is the term “fluffy”—a label Midkiff uses to summarize critiques by scholars Ruth Stein (1968) and Margaret Blount (1974), who lamented the shift toward sanitized, harmless dragons. While Stein and Blount did not employ the word themselves, Midkiff adopts it to highlight their shared concern that such depictions dilute dragons’ capacity to evoke awe or fear. Her analysis, however, reveals that even “fluffy” dragons retain uncanny traits inherited from their mythic roots, ensuring their enduring relevance as symbols of psychological complexity.  

## Journal Context: Fafnir and Norse Mythology  
The journal *Fafnir: Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research* derives its name from the mythological dragon Fafnir, whose story intertwines with themes of greed, transformation, and the uncanny. In Norse lore, Fafnir was one of three sons of Hreidmar. After his father’s murder, he transformed into a dragon to guard the cursed treasure of Andvari, symbolizing the corrupting power of wealth and the blurred line between human and monstrous. This duality—of guardian and threat, wealth and peril—anchors the journal’s focus on exploring fantasy’s symbolic and cultural significance.  

Midkiff’s article aligns with this thematic scope by examining how modern children’s literature reimagines dragons. Fafnir’s mythic role as a hoarder of treasure and embodiment of primal fear provides a framework for analyzing dragons’ evolution from fearsome creatures to “fluffy” companions. The journal’s name thus underscores its mission to bridge ancient myth with contemporary storytelling, revealing how dragons continue to reflect humanity’s fascination with the unknown.  

## Stein and Blount’s Dual Critique  
Ruth Stein and Margaret Blount, writing decades apart, shared a critique of dragons’ domestication in children’s literature, though their arguments diverged in emphasis.  

### Key Critiques: A Comparative Overview  
| Author       | Year | Core Argument                                                                 | Targeted Depictions                          | Desired Outcome                                  |  
|--------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
| **Ruth Stein** | 1968 | Dragons were becoming "cuddly" and losing their mythic terror.               | Comedic or pet-like dragons (e.g., *The Reluctant Dragon*) | Dragons should retain their fearsome, archetypal nature. |  
| **Margaret Blount** | 1974 | Dragons must inspire awe, even if not terrifying; overly humanized versions fail. | Dragons reduced to fire-breathing humans (e.g., "household" dragons) | Dragons should maintain symbolic significance and primal impact. |  

**Stein’s Critique (1968):** Stein, writing in *Elementary Education*, contrasted J.R.R. Tolkien’s fearsome Smaug (*The Hobbit*) with dragons increasingly portrayed as harmless or comical. She argued that reducing dragons to “cuddly” figures stripped them of their role as symbols of primordial fear, severing their connection to mythic archetypes.  

**Blount’s Critique (1974):** In her book, Blount expanded on Stein’s concerns, emphasizing that dragons need not be physically threatening to retain their symbolic power. She condemned stories where dragons were reduced to fire-breathing humans, lacking the eerie presence that defined their mythic origins. For Blount, even a less fearsome dragon could evoke awe if it carried traits like cunning or an unsettling gaze.  

Both scholars shared a disdain for dragons that prioritized humor or safety over their capacity to unsettle, yet their critiques diverged in focus: Stein emphasized the loss of terror, while Blount prioritized the retention of symbolic awe.  

## Midkiff’s Framing: The “Fluffy” Label  
While Stein and Blount did not use the term “fluffy,” Midkiff adopts it to encapsulate their critiques of dragons’ domestication. The label reflects a deliberate aesthetic shift—dragons with soft fur, rounded features, and non-threatening behaviors—but also a metaphorical dilution of their mythic essence. Midkiff argues that this term highlights a cultural negotiation: the desire to shield children from fear versus the need to preserve dragons’ symbolic potency.  

Crucially, Midkiff reframes the “fluffy” label as a paradox. Even in tamed forms, dragons retain uncanny traits inherited from their mythic ancestors. For instance, a dragon’s ability to manipulate language or fixate its gaze on a protagonist evokes Freudian concepts of the *uncanny*—a discomfort arising from the familiar becoming alien. These traits ensure dragons remain psychologically potent figures, embodying the duality of familiarity and threat that defines their mythic legacy.  

## Cultural Implications of the “Fluffy” Trend  
The “fluffy” dragon trend reflects broader societal attitudes toward childhood narratives. Modern children’s literature often prioritizes safety, humor, and relatability, sidelining darker themes or ambiguous moral lessons. Stein and Blount’s critiques, as Midkiff interprets them, voice a fear that such sanitization infantilizes children by denying them access to stories that confront existential or moral complexity.  

However, Midkiff’s analysis complicates this narrative. By retaining uncanny elements—such as manipulative speech or a lingering connection to fire—“fluffy” dragons still engage with primal fears, albeit in diluted forms. This duality suggests that children’s literature can navigate a middle ground: stories that are accessible yet retain mythic resonance. The “fluffy” dragon thus becomes a cultural mirror, reflecting both a desire for comfort and an unconscious pull toward the unknown.  

## Conclusion  
Emily Midkiff’s article underscores the enduring significance of dragons as symbols of the uncanny, even in their “fluffified” forms. While Stein and Blount critiqued the loss of mythic terror, Midkiff reveals that dragons’ core essence persists through traits like the piercing gaze or manipulative speech—vestiges of their role as psychological foils to humanity. The term “fluffy,” far from dismissing dragons as trivial, encapsulates a dynamic interplay between tradition and modernity.  

Dragons in children’s literature remain potent precisely because they straddle the line between safety and danger, familiarity and strangeness. Their evolution reflects a cultural negotiation: how to preserve mythic depth while adapting to evolving storytelling norms. By framing dragons as liminal beings, Midkiff’s work challenges us to recognize their dual nature as both guardians of treasure and keepers of the human psyche’s unresolved tensions. In this light, the “fluffy” dragon is not a diluted symbol but a testament to myth’s resilience—a creature that, even in its softest forms, continues to unsettle and inspire.
