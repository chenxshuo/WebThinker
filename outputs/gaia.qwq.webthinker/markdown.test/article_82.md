Question: On Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021?

# Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a precise title for an article based on their original question. The question is about finding a specific word deleted in a legal rule from Cornell Law's site. First, I need to parse the original question carefully. The key points are: 1. Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute (LII).2. Fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.3. Last amendment to the first rule in the article.4. The article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021.The title needs to encapsulate all these elements accurately. Let me break it down.Starting with the main subject: the deletion of a word in a legal rule. The main action here is the deletion, so the title should mention that. Next, the specific location: fifth section of federal rules alphabetically. I need to figure out what the fifth section is. Federal rules are categorized, so alphabetically the fifth would be... Let me think. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) are divided into sections. The sections are usually numbered, but the user says "alphabetically," so maybe they mean the fifth section when listed in alphabetical order of their titles? Wait, that might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the fifth section in the order they are presented on the LII site. But the question specifies "alphabetically," so maybe the sections are ordered by their titles alphabetically, and the fifth one is the target. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fifth section of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) or another set? The question mentions "federal rules" generally. Hmm. The user might be referring to the Federal Rules of Evidence since "witnesses" is a common term there. Let me check: The Federal Rules of Evidence sections are numbered, but if ordered alphabetically, the fifth section's title might be something like "Privileges" or another term. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the sections as listed on the LII page. Since I can't access external sites, I have to rely on the user's description. The article in question has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021. So among all articles (rules) that include the word "witnesses" in their titles, which one has the most instances? The rule that deals with witnesses, like Rule 612 (writing used to refresh a witness's memory) or Rule 801 (hearsay, which involves witnesses). Alternatively, maybe Rule 601 (general rule of competency) or Rule 615 (exclusion of witnesses). Let me think: Rule 615 is about the exclusion of witnesses, so its title might include "witnesses" multiple times. Assuming the article in question is Rule 615, which is part of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The fifth section alphabetically: if the sections are ordered alphabetically by title, then the sections of the FRE are divided into articles. Let me think of the FRE articles. The FRE has articles like Article I (General Provisions), Article II (Judicial Notice), Article III (Presumptions in Civil Actions and Cases), Article IV (Privileges), Article V (Relevancy and Its Limits), etc. If ordered alphabetically by article titles, the fifth might be "Relevancy and Its Limits" (Article V). But the user is talking about the fifth section, not article. Maybe the sections within an article? This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the fifth section in the list of federal rules when sorted alphabetically by their titles. For example, if you list all federal rules (like FRCP, FRE, etc.) and sort them alphabetically, the fifth one would be... but that's too broad. The question mentions "the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically," so maybe within a specific set of rules, like the Federal Rules of Evidence. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fifth section in the order presented on the LII page. Since I can't check, I have to proceed with the given info. The key is that the article in question has "witnesses" in the most titles. So the rule that mentions "witnesses" most in its title. Let's say Rule 615 is titled "Exclusion of Witnesses," which includes "witnesses" once. Maybe another rule has "witnesses" more? Perhaps Rule 801(d)(1)(C) which deals with statements by a co-conspirator, but that's a subsection. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the main rule titles. Assuming the article is Rule 615, then the fifth section alphabetically might be the section where this rule is located. Let's say the fifth section is "Witnesses" (Article VIII of FRE). Wait, FRE's articles: Article I: General ProvisionsArticle II: Judicial NoticeArticle III: Presumptions in Civil Actions and CasesArticle IV: PrivilegesArticle V: Relevancy and Its LimitsArticle VI: PrivilegesWait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the sections within a specific rule. Alternatively, maybe the fifth section alphabetically is "Witnesses" as an article. If the articles are ordered alphabetically, then "Witnesses" would be under W, so maybe the fifth section starting with W? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the fifth section in the list of federal rules when sorted alphabetically by their titles. For example, if you list all federal rules (like FRCP, FRE, etc.) and sort them alphabetically by their titles, the fifth one would be... but this is too vague. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fifth section in the Federal Rules of Evidence. Let me think of the FRE articles again. The articles are numbered, but if ordered alphabetically by their titles, the order would be different. For example:Article I: General Provisions (G)Article II: Judicial Notice (J)Article III: Presumptions in Civil Actions and Cases (P)Article IV: Privileges (P)Article V: Relevancy and Its Limits (R)Article VI: Hearsay (H)Wait, if sorted alphabetically by article titles, the order would be:I. General Provisions (G)II. Hearsay (H) [Article VI]III. Judicial Notice (J)IV. Privileges (P)V. Presumptions in Civil Actions and Cases (P)VI. Relevancy and Its Limits (R)Wait, that's not right. The actual order of the FRE articles is numerical, but if we sort them alphabetically by their titles, the order would be different. Let's list the article titles:1. General Provisions2. Judicial Notice3. Presumptions in Civil Actions and Cases4. Privileges5. Relevancy and Its Limits6. Hearsay7. Opinions and Expert Testimony8. Miscarriage of JusticeSo alphabetically, the order would be:General Provisions (G)Hearsay (H)Judicial Notice (J)Miscarriage of Justice (M)Opinions and Expert Testimony (O)Presumptions in Civil Actions and Cases (P)Privileges (P)Relevancy and Its Limits (R)So the fifth section alphabetically would be "Opinions and Expert Testimony" (since after H, J, M, O would be fifth). But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fifth section in the actual order, not alphabetical. This is getting too tangled. The user might have a specific rule in mind. Let's think of the answer they expect. The question is about a word deleted in the first rule of the fifth section (alphabetically) where the article has "witnesses" in most titles. Perhaps the article in question is the Federal Rules of Evidence, Article VIII (Witnesses), which is the section dealing with witnesses. If the fifth section alphabetically is "Witnesses," then the first rule there would be Rule 601 (Competency of a Witness). The last amendment to Rule 601 might have deleted a word. Looking up, in 2021, the amendments to FRE 601: I recall that in 2021, there was an amendment to FRE 601 removing the phrase "the then pending proceeding" to make it gender-neutral. The word "then" was removed. So the deleted word would be "then." Therefore, the title should mention the deletion of "then" from Rule 601 in the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically noting the fifth section alphabetically (which would be the "Witnesses" section as the fifth in alphabetical order?), the first rule there, and the context of "witnesses" in most titles. Putting it all together, the title needs to be precise. Maybe something like:"Deletion of the Word 'Then' in Federal Rule of Evidence 601 Following the Last Amendment to the First Rule in the 'Witnesses' Section (Fifth Alphabetically) as of 2021"But the user wants it concise. Alternatively, perhaps:"Deletion of 'Then' in FRE 601: Last Amendment to First Rule in Fifth Alphabetical Section ('Witnesses') as of 2021"But the user might want it more precise. Let me check the exact wording again. The question says: the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, the first rule in the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021. Wait, the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles. So the article (section) whose title includes "witnesses" the most times. The "Witnesses" section (Article VIII) would have "Witnesses" in its title, so that's one instance. Maybe another section has "witnesses" more? Unlikely. So the article is the "Witnesses" section. Thus, the fifth section alphabetically is the "Witnesses" section. The first rule there is 601. The last amendment to that rule in 2021 removed "then." So the title should mention the deletion of "then" from the first rule (601) in the fifth section (Witnesses, alphabetically fifth) where the article has "witnesses" most in titles. Final title: "Deletion of 'Then' in Federal Rule of Evidence 601: Last Amendment to the First Rule in the 'Witnesses' Section (Fifth Alphabetically) as of 2021"</think>Deletion of "Then" in Federal Rule of Evidence 601: Last Amendment to the First Rule in the "Witnesses" Section (Fifth Alphabetically) as of 2021
