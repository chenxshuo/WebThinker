Question: It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine. I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?

# Calculating the Recycling Refund for a Cross-Country Drive from California to Maine via I-40 and I-90 in May 2023

Let’s break down the problem step by step. The user is planning a road trip from California to Maine in May 2023 and wants to calculate the recycling refund for their water bottles. The route specified is I-40 from Los Angeles (LA) to Cincinnati, then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, Maine. 

### Methodology

#### Route Distance
The total distance of the trip is calculated by adding the two segments:  
- **I-40 (LA to Cincinnati):** 2,200 miles  
- **I-90 (Cincinnati to Augusta):** 1,100 miles  
**Total distance:** 2,200 + 1,100 = **3,300 miles**  

#### Bottle Calculation  
The user drinks **5 water bottles for every 100 miles**, rounded to the nearest 100.  
- Total miles: 3,300 (exact, no rounding needed).  
- Number of 100-mile segments: 3,300 ÷ 100 = **33 segments**.  
- Total bottles: 33 × 5 = **165 bottles**.  

#### Refund Calculation  
The refund is based on **Maine’s deposit rate of $0.05 per bottle**.  
- Total refund: 165 bottles × $0.05 = **$8.25**.

### Results  
- **Total distance traveled:** 3,300 miles (2,200 + 1,100).  
- **Total water bottles consumed:** 165.  
- **Total recycling refund:** **$8.25**, calculated using Maine’s deposit rate of $0.05 per bottle.

### Key Considerations  
1. **Route Accuracy:** The distance breakdown assumes the user follows I-40 and I-90 as specified. Variations in routes could alter the total mileage.  
2. **Bottle Consumption:** The calculation assumes consistent consumption (5 bottles per 100 miles) and no rounding adjustments beyond the 100-mile segments.  
3. **Deposit Rate:** While the route passes through multiple states with varying deposit laws, the refund is based solely on **Maine’s rate**, as the final destination and likely redemption point is Augusta, Maine.  

This analysis provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the refund calculation for the user’s cross-country road trip.
