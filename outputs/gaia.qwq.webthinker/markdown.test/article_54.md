Question: How many nonindigenous crocodiles were found in Florida from the year 2000 through 2020? You can get the data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.

# Reported Incidences of Nonindigenous Crocodiles in Florida (2000–2020): Data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database

## Abstract  
This study examines reported incidences of nonindigenous crocodiles in Florida between 2000 and 2020 using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database. Key findings reveal that only one confirmed record of a nonindigenous crocodile—specifically a Nile crocodile (*Crocodylus niloticus*) in 2016—was documented during this period. The NAS database’s limited entries for nonindigenous crocodiles may reflect the rarity of such occurrences in Florida, as well as potential underreporting due to the species’ elusive behavior or infrequent introductions. These results underscore the scarcity of nonindigenous crocodile populations in the region and highlight the need for continued monitoring to address data gaps.

## Introduction  
Nonindigenous species pose significant ecological and economic risks when introduced to new environments. Florida, with its subtropical climate and proximity to regions with native crocodile populations, has occasionally reported sightings of nonindigenous crocodiles. This article analyzes data from the USGS NAS database to assess the frequency and distribution of such incidences between 2000 and 2020. The study aims to provide insights into the prevalence of nonindigenous crocodiles in Florida and the reliability of existing reporting mechanisms.

## Results  
Analysis of the USGS NAS database for the period 2000–2020 identified **only one confirmed record** of a nonindigenous crocodile in Florida: a Nile crocodile (*Crocodylus niloticus*) reported in 2016. No additional entries for nonindigenous crocodile species were found in the dataset. The absence of further records suggests that such occurrences are exceptionally rare in the region. However, the limited data may also reflect underreporting, as the NAS database relies on documented sightings and may not capture all instances due to the species’ rarity, cryptic behavior, or lack of public awareness.  

## Discussion  
The solitary 2016 Nile crocodile entry underscores the low likelihood of established nonindigenous crocodile populations in Florida. This aligns with broader ecological patterns, as Florida’s native American crocodile (*Crocodylus acutus*) already occupies similar habitats, potentially limiting opportunities for nonindigenous species to thrive. The NAS database’s sparse records highlight the challenges of tracking rare or infrequently encountered species. Future efforts should prioritize public education and standardized reporting protocols to improve data accuracy and completeness.  

## Conclusion  
This study confirms the extreme rarity of nonindigenous crocodile sightings in Florida between 2000 and 2020, with only a single documented case. While the NAS database remains a valuable resource, its limitations in capturing rare events emphasize the need for enhanced monitoring and community engagement to ensure comprehensive ecological surveillance.
