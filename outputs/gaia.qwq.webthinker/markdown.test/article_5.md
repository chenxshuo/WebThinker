# How Many Studio Albums Did Mercedes Sosa Release Between 2000 and 2009? A Wikipedia-Based Analysis (2022)

## Introduction  
Mercedes Sosa, revered as the "voice of the voiceless" and a cornerstone of Latin American folk music, carved a legacy through her powerful performances and advocacy for social justice. Born in 1935 in Argentina’s Tucumán province, Sosa rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leading figure of the *nueva canción* movement, blending traditional folk rhythms with politically charged lyrics. Her career spanned over five decades, marked by resilience through political turmoil, exile, and eventual international acclaim. By the turn of the 21st century, Sosa had become a cultural icon, celebrated for her ability to unite audiences across borders through music.  

This study focuses on a critical yet understudied phase of her career: the number of **studio albums** she released between 2000 and 2009, the final decade of her life. This period was marked by both artistic evolution and personal reflection, as Sosa continued to record and perform globally while grappling with health challenges. Understanding her output during this time offers insights into her creative trajectory and enduring influence.  

The investigation relies on the **2022 English Wikipedia entry** as the primary source, given its comprehensive yet evolving nature. However, ambiguities in album categorization—such as distinguishing studio recordings from live performances, compilations, or reissues—pose challenges. For instance, albums like *Gracias a la Vida* (often cited as a 2005 studio release) may overlap with earlier live versions, while posthumous releases like *Cantora* (2009) require verification of their original recording dates.  

Studio albums are defined here as **original, newly recorded works** produced and released within the 2000–2009 timeframe, excluding re-releases, live recordings, or curated compilations. This distinction is crucial, as Sosa’s discography includes both groundbreaking original works and retrospective projects. The analysis navigates these complexities to provide a clear count, emphasizing the need for precise categorization to honor her artistic contributions accurately. By contextualizing her late-career output, this study illuminates Sosa’s enduring relevance and the cultural significance of her final recordings.

## Methodology  

The methodology for determining the number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive) was structured to ensure accuracy and reliability, leveraging the 2022 version of the English Wikipedia as the primary source. The process involved four core steps, each designed to systematically address potential ambiguities in album categorization and release dates.  

### **1. Source Identification and Selection**  
The investigation began by accessing the English Wikipedia page for Mercedes Sosa (version as of 2022). The page’s **Discography** section was the focal point, as it typically provides structured information on an artist’s recorded works. Wikipedia was chosen due to its status as a widely referenced, collaboratively edited platform, though its limitations (e.g., incomplete or inconsistent data) were acknowledged. Additional sources, such as official discographies and music databases (e.g., Discogs, AllMusic), were considered secondary for cross-verification when discrepancies arose.  

### **2. Data Extraction and Categorization**  
From the Wikipedia discography, entries were extracted and categorized based on explicit labels (e.g., "Studio albums," "Compilation albums") and contextual descriptions. Albums marked as **studio albums** were prioritized, while others (e.g., live recordings, reissues, or compilations) were excluded unless reclassified through further analysis. Key details extracted included:  
- **Album Title**  
- **Release Year**  
- **Categorization (Studio/Non-Studio)**  
- **Additional Notes** (e.g., collaborations, thematic focus).  

### **3. Date Filtering and Temporal Constraints**  
Albums were filtered to include only those with release years explicitly stated as **2000–2009**. Ambiguous entries (e.g., albums with disputed release dates or lacking precise years) were flagged for further validation.  

### **4. Validation and Resolution of Discrepancies**  
To address potential inaccuracies in Wikipedia’s discography, secondary sources were consulted. For example:  
- **Official Discographies**: Mercedes Sosa’s official website or authorized biographies were referenced to confirm studio album status.  
- **Music Databases**: Platforms like Discogs or AllMusic were used to verify release dates and categorizations.  
- **Cross-Referencing**: Conflicting titles (e.g., *Gracias a la Vida* vs. *Corazón Libre*) were analyzed to determine whether they represented distinct studio albums or reissues.  

### **Constraints and Limitations**  
- **Incomplete Discography Data**: The Wikipedia discography section lacked detailed categorizations for some albums, requiring reliance on external sources.  
- **Title Variations**: Regional or alternate titles (e.g., *Al Sur del Sur* vs. *Argentina Quiere Cantar*) caused confusion, necessitating cross-verification.  
- **Reissue Ambiguity**: Distinguishing between original studio albums and reissues/remastered editions posed challenges, particularly for older works like *Misa Criolla*.
