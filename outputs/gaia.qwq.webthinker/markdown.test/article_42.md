Question: Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?

# FunkMonk and the 2016 Promotion of *Giganotosaurus* as a Wikipedia Featured Article  

## Introduction  
The English Wikipedia community upholds a rigorous process to designate articles as "Featured Articles" (FAs), representing the platform’s highest standard of quality. To achieve this status, an article must demonstrate comprehensive coverage of its subject, adhere to core principles like neutrality and verifiability, and exhibit polished writing and presentation. Each nomination undergoes a collaborative review process, where editors scrutinize the article against the FA criteria, often involving multiple rounds of feedback and revisions.  

In November 2016, the sole dinosaur-themed article to meet these stringent requirements was *Giganotosaurus*, a genus of large carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period. This article’s promotion highlights the intersection of scientific accuracy, editorial diligence, and community consensus. The nomination was initiated by **FunkMonk**, a seasoned Wikipedia contributor with expertise in paleontology and natural history topics. FunkMonk’s role as the primary nominator was supported by a network of editors who contributed reviews, critiques, and suggestions, underscoring the collaborative nature of FA promotions.  

The selection of *Giganotosaurus* exemplifies how Wikipedia’s FA criteria are applied to specialized subjects. The article’s success stemmed from its thorough sourcing of peer-reviewed studies, its balanced synthesis of anatomical, ecological, and paleontological data, and its clear, engaging prose. Reviewers praised its structure, which organized complex information into digestible sections, while also noting its high-quality images and adherence to citation standards. This case study illustrates not only the meticulous process behind FA designation but also the community’s commitment to showcasing well-researched, accessible content on niche yet significant topics.
