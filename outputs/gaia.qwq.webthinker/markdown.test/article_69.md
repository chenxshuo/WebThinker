Question: What is the last word before the second chorus of the King of Pop's fifth single from his sixth studio album?

# Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a precise title for an article based on the original question provided. The question is asking for the last word before the second chorus of the King of Pop's fifth single from his sixth studio album.First, I need to figure out which song and album they're referring to. The King of Pop is Michael Jackson. His sixth studio album is "Bad," released in 1987. The fifth single from that album was "The Way You Make Me Feel." Now, the next part is determining the last word before the second chorus. To do that, I should look at the song's structure. Let me recall the lyrics of "The Way You Make Me Feel." The first chorus goes, "You make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like a man..." Then after the first verse and pre-chorus, the second chorus comes in. Wait, actually, maybe I should check the song structure more carefully. Let me think: The song starts with an intro, then the first verse, followed by a pre-chorus, then the first chorus. Then another verse, another pre-chorus, and then the second chorus. The line before the second chorus would be the end of the pre-chorus. Looking at the lyrics, after the first chorus, the second verse goes something like "I can't get enough of your love, baby..." Then the pre-chorus again: "You're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living..." leading into the second chorus. Wait, maybe the pre-chorus is repeated before each chorus. So the line before the second chorus would be the last line of the pre-chorus. The pre-chorus lines are: "You're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living..." So the last word there is "living." But I need to confirm the exact lyrics. Alternatively, maybe the line before the second chorus is part of the verse. Let me check the actual lyrics again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is verse, chorus, verse, chorus. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact lyrics structure. Let me think again. The song's structure is typically verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, etc. So the second chorus is preceded by the pre-chorus. The pre-chorus lines are "You're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living, you're the reason I'm living..." So the last word before the second chorus would be "living." Therefore, the answer to the original question is "living." But the user wants the article title based on that question. The title should encapsulate the question's essence. So something like "The Last Word Before the Second Chorus in Michael Jackson's 'The Way You Make Me Feel' Revealed" or more precisely, since the answer is "living," maybe "The Final Word Before the Second Chorus of 'The Way You Make Me Feel' by Michael Jackson is 'Living'". But the user wants the title to be precise and directly answer the question. However, the user's instruction says to generate the title based on the original question, not the answer. Wait, the article's current content isn't provided, but the user wants the title to be for the article that answers the question. So the title should be a question that matches the original question. Alternatively, maybe the title should be phrased as a question, like "What is the Last Word Before the Second Chorus of Michael Jackson's Fifth Single from His Sixth Studio Album?" But the user might want it more concise. Since the King of Pop is Michael Jackson, and the fifth single from his sixth album (Bad) is "The Way You Make Me Feel," the title could be more specific. But the user's instruction says to generate the title based on the original question, so perhaps keeping the original phrasing but making it a title. The original question is: "What is the last word before the second chorus of the King of Pop's fifth single from his sixth studio album?" So the title could be exactly that, but formatted as a title. Capitalizing each major word: "What Is the Last Word Before the Second Chorus of the King of Pop's Fifth Single from His Sixth Studio Album?" But maybe making it a bit more concise. Alternatively, since the answer is known, perhaps the title includes the answer, but the user says to generate the title based on the question, not the answer. The user's instruction says "directly output the title, do not include any other text," so the title should be the question phrased as a title. Therefore, the precise title would be: "What Is the Last Word Before the Second Chorus of the King of Pop's Fifth Single from His Sixth Studio Album?"</think>What Is the Last Word Before the Second Chorus of the King of Pop's Fifth Single from His Sixth Studio Album?
