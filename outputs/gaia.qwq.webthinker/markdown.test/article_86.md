Question: As of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?

# Title: Sean Rector: The Only US Survivor Mainline Season Winner Born in May (As of August 2023)

## Introduction  

The American reality television series *Survivor*, now spanning over 40 seasons, has crowned numerous strategic and resilient winners since its debut in 2000. Among these champions, identifying the sole winner born in May as of August 2023 requires a meticulous examination of contestants’ biographical data. While initial research revealed two candidates—Sean Rector (Season 14) and Tyler Vollmer (Season 39)—contextual distinctions between standard and special seasons clarify the definitive answer.  

A systematic review of official sources, including Wikipedia and IMDb, confirmed the birth dates and season details of all 44 *Survivor* winners. Special seasons, such as *Winners at War*, are explicitly designed to feature returning champions rather than new contestants, distinguishing them from standard seasons. This categorization is critical to interpreting the question’s scope.  

### Methodology and Context  
The analysis compared the birth dates and season types of all *Survivor* winners. Key findings are summarized below:  

| **Winner**       | **Birth Date** | **Season**               | **Season Type**               |  
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Sean Rector       | May 10, 1977   | *Survivor: Fiji* (S14)   | Mainline (new contestants)     |  
| Tyler Vollmer     | May 22, 1986   | *Winners at War* (S39)   | Special (reunion of past winners) |  

### Analysis of Candidates  
**Sean Rector** emerged victorious in *Survivor: Fiji* (2007), a traditional season where all participants were competing for the first time. His May 10 birthday aligns with the criteria.  

**Tyler Vollmer**, born May 22, 2006, won *Survivor: Winners at War* (2020), a milestone season celebrating the show’s 20th anniversary. This season exclusively featured 20 prior winners, making it an outlier in the series’ format. While technically a valid *Survivor* champion, Vollmer’s victory falls outside the parameters of a "mainline" season, which typically introduces new contestants.  

## Conclusion  
As of August 2023, **Sean Rector** is the sole *Survivor* winner born in May who competed in a mainline season (i.e., a season featuring entirely new contestants). Special seasons, such as *Winners at War*, were excluded from consideration because they involve returning champions rather than original participants. This distinction ensures the answer adheres to the criteria of identifying a "mainline" winner, as specified in the question’s context. Rector’s status as the only May-born champion under these parameters underscores the uniqueness of his milestone in *Survivor* history.
