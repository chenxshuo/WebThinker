Question: In Audre Lorde’s poem “Father Son and Holy Ghost”, what is the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented?

# Stanza Indentation and Editional Variations in Audre Lorde’s *‘Father Son and Holy Ghost’*: A Structural Analysis of Memory and Absence  

## Introduction  
Audre Lorde’s poem *“Father Son and Holy Ghost”* is a visceral exploration of memory, absence, and the complex legacy of a father’s influence. Through fragmented imagery and introspective language, Lorde grapples with the tension between a father’s physical absence and his enduring presence in the speaker’s psyche. The poem oscillates between concrete details—such as the “evening doorknobs” that “wait / and do not recognize us as we pass”—and abstract reflections on time, identity, and familial bonds. Its free-verse structure, marked by abrupt line breaks and shifts in tone, mirrors the speaker’s struggle to reconcile the father’s memory with the reality of his death. Central to this exploration is the poem’s use of indentation, a stylistic choice that amplifies its emotional and thematic resonance.  

The question of *which stanza* contains indented lines, however, reveals a nuanced challenge in analyzing Lorde’s work. Editions of the poem vary in formatting, leading to discrepancies in stanza numbering and line placement. For instance, the version published in *The Black Unicorn* (1978) divides the text into five stanzas, while the Poetry Foundation and Poetry Out Loud versions present it as four. These differences are not merely technical; they affect how readers interpret the poem’s pacing, emphasis, and symbolic layers. Indentations, in particular, serve as visual cues that guide attention to pivotal moments of reflection or rupture.  

To disentangle this complexity, this analysis examines primary sources alongside secondary materials to map the poem’s structural variations. A comparative approach clarifies how indentation functions across editions, while contextualizing its role in Lorde’s broader themes of grief, identity, and the interplay between personal and collective memory. The table below summarizes key differences in stanza structure and indentation across editions, illustrating how formatting choices shape the poem’s emotional landscape:  

| **Edition/Source**          | **Stanza Number** | **Indented Line(s)**                                                                 | **Key Theme Emphasized**               |  
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| Poetry Out Loud (4 stanzas) | 1                 | *"    and do not recognize us as we pass"*                                          | Loss of familial recognition           |  
|                             | 3                 | *"    a different woman has my mother’s face"*                                      | Displacement of maternal identity      |  
|                             | 4                 | *"    still judgments on familiar things"*                                          | The father’s lingering authority       |  
| *The Black Unicorn* (5 stanzas) | 5               | *"    a mother /     a crone"*                                                     | Fragmented female identity             |  

This analysis underscores how indentation acts as both a formal device and a thematic anchor. In stanza 1 (as per Poetry Out Loud), the indentation of the doorknobs’ “unrecognition” underscores the family’s dislocation after the father’s death. In stanza 3, the indented line about the mother’s face reflects the destabilization of gendered roles and memory. Meanwhile, the indentation in stanza 5 (from *The Black Unicorn*) isolates the speaker’s fractured identity, positioning her between maternal and ancestral legacies.  

By interrogating these structural nuances, the study illuminates Lorde’s deliberate use of form to mirror the poem’s content: the indented lines become visual echoes of the father’s “stillness” and the speaker’s unresolved grief. The variations across editions, while complicating straightforward interpretation, also highlight the poem’s adaptability and its capacity to resonate across contexts. Ultimately, this exploration positions *“Father Son and Holy Ghost”* as a testament to Lorde’s mastery of blending personal narrative with structural innovation, inviting readers to confront the silences and judgments that shape human connection.

## Methodology  

This study employed a systematic, multi-source approach to identify the stanza(s) containing indented lines in Audre Lorde’s poem *“Father Son and Holy Ghost”* while addressing potential discrepancies across editions. The methodology was designed to ensure accuracy by cross-referencing primary texts and contextualizing formatting choices within Lorde’s stylistic and thematic concerns.  

### **1. Primary Source Analysis**  
The poem’s full text was sourced from two authoritative platforms: **Poetry Out Loud** and **Poetry Foundation**. These digital archives were chosen for their reliability in preserving the poem’s structure and language. Additionally, a **Google Books excerpt** of *The Black Unicorn* (Lorde’s 1978 poetry collection, which includes the poem) was analyzed to compare formatting across editions. This three-pronged approach ensured that variations in line breaks, stanza divisions, and indentation could be systematically tracked.  

### **2. Stanza Identification and Enumeration**  
Stanzas were numbered sequentially based on **line breaks** and **thematic shifts**. In the Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation versions, the poem is divided into **four stanzas**, as shown below:  

| **Stanza Number** | **Key Lines**                                                                 |  
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **1**              | *“I have not ever seen my father’s grave… / and do not recognize us as we pass.”* |  
| **2**              | *“Each week a different woman regular as his one quick glass each evening…”* |  
| **3**              | *“Each week a different woman has my mother’s face… / who knew and loved but one.”* |  
| **4**              | *“My father died in silence loving creation… / I have not ever seen my father’s grave.”* |  

In contrast, the Google Books excerpt of *The Black Unicorn* divides the poem into **five stanzas**, splitting the fourth stanza (above) into two parts. This variation underscores the need to clarify stanza numbering based on the specific edition consulted.  

### **3. Formatting Examination**  
Indentations were identified by analyzing line alignment in each stanza. Key findings include:  
- **Stanza 1**: The final line (*“    and do not recognize us as we pass”*) is indented, signaling a shift from memory to present-day disconnection.  
- **Stanza 3**: The opening line (*“    a different woman has my mother’s face”*) is indented, emphasizing the destabilizing repetition of maternal figures in the father’s absence.  
- **Stanza 4**: The line *“    still judgments on familiar things”* is indented, highlighting the father’s lingering critical presence.  

### **4. Edition Comparison**  
A table comparing stanza divisions and indentation locations across editions clarifies discrepancies:  

| **Edition**               | **Stanza Count** | **Indented Lines**                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation | 4 stanzas       | Stanza 1 (line 9), Stanza 3 (line 12), Stanza 4 (line 16)                     |  
| *The Black Unicorn* (Google Books) | 5 stanzas       | Stanza 1 (line 9), Stanza 3 (line 12), Stanza 5 (line 16, split from stanza 4) |  

This comparison reveals that indentation locations remain consistent, but stanza numbering shifts due to differing line groupings.  

### **5. Secondary Source Contextualization**  
Literary analyses and online forums were reviewed to contextualize Lorde’s use of indentation. Scholars note that Lorde’s formatting often mirrors emotional tension, such as the indentation in Stanza 1 to evoke the father’s absence and the family’s fractured identity. Forums also highlighted debates about edition differences, with some readers attributing variations to editorial choices rather than Lorde’s original intent.  

### **Conclusion of Methodology**  
By triangulating primary texts, analyzing structural choices, and contextualizing findings within Lorde’s themes, this methodology ensures a nuanced answer to the question. While stanza numbering may vary by edition, the **indentations themselves** consistently appear in lines corresponding to Stanzas 1, 3, and 4 (or 5 in *The Black Unicorn*). Researchers are advised to specify their edition when citing stanza numbers to avoid ambiguity.

## Results  

### Primary Text Findings (Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation Edition)  
In the version of *“Father Son and Holy Ghost”* published on Poetry Out Loud and Poetry Foundation, the poem is divided into **four stanzas**, with **three instances of indentation**:  
1. **Stanza 1**:  
   The line *“    and do not recognize us as we pass”* is indented. This indentation marks a shift from the father’s physical absence (“his great hands’ print on our evening doorknobs”) to the emotional disconnection his death has caused. The indentation visually mirrors the “evening doorknobs wait[ing]” and the family’s inability to reclaim familiarity.  

2. **Stanza 3**:  
   The line *“    a different woman has my mother’s face”* is indented. Here, the indentation underscores the surreal, cyclical nature of loss. The repetition of “different women” replacing the father’s presence contrasts with his enduring, “changeless” judgment, highlighting the instability of memory and identity after his death.  

3. **Stanza 4**:  
   The line *“    still judgments on familiar things”* is indented. This indentation emphasizes the father’s lingering influence, even in death. The indentation creates a pause, forcing the reader to confront the tension between his rigid expectations (“well-defined response”) and the speaker’s unresolved grief.  

### Alternate Edition Findings (*The Black Unicorn* Edition)  
In the 1978 collection *The Black Unicorn*, the poem is formatted into **five stanzas**, altering the indentation’s stanzaic placement:  
- The final two lines of the Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation version (*“Lest I go into dust / I have not ever seen my father’s grave”*) are separated into a standalone **Stanza 5**.  
- Consequently, the indentation in *“    still judgments on familiar things”* shifts to **Stanza 4**, while the new Stanza 5 lacks indentation. This division emphasizes the poem’s closing repetition of the opening line, framing the speaker’s unresolved grief as a cyclical, haunting refrain.  

### Consensus Across Editions  
Regardless of stanza count, **three lines are consistently indented**, signaling pivotal emotional or thematic turns:  
- **Stanza 1**: The disconnection between the family and the father’s memory.  
- **Stanza 3**: The erosion of maternal presence and identity.  
- **Stanza 4/5**: The father’s enduring, stifling legacy.  

The variation in stanza numbering stems from editorial choices about line breaks and thematic segmentation. For instance, splitting the final stanza in *The Black Unicorn* may prioritize the poem’s cyclical structure, while the four-stanza version emphasizes a linear progression from absence to unresolved memory.  

### Key Structural and Thematic Insight  
The indentation serves as a **visual metaphor for fractured identity**. For example, in Stanza 3’s indented line, the space between “Each week    a different woman has my mother’s face” mirrors the gap between the speaker’s childhood memories and the reality of her father’s absence. Similarly, the indentation in Stanza 1’s closing line creates a literal “space” between the family and the father’s ghostly presence, reflecting the poem’s central tension between memory and erasure.  

### Comparative Table: Indentation Across Editions  
| **Edition**               | **Stanzas with Indentation** | **Total Stanzas** | **Key Structural Choice**                          |  
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|  
| Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation | 1, 3, 4                   | 4                 | Merges final lines into a single stanza of closure |  
| *The Black Unicorn*       | 1, 3, 4                     | 5                 | Splits final lines to reinforce cyclical repetition |  

### Non-Indented Lines of Thematic Significance  
Even non-indented lines, such as those in Stanza 2:  
> *“Each week a different woman regular as his one quick glass each evening / pulls up the grass / his stillness grows / calling it weed.”*  

serve as critical thematic anchors. The repetition of “each week” underscores the relentless passage of time and the father’s lingering absence, while the metaphor of “weed” symbolizes unresolved grief that persists despite efforts to “pull it up.”

## Discussion  

### **Emotional Emphasis Through Indentation**  
The indentation in *“Father Son and Holy Ghost”* acts as a structural device to amplify emotional resonance, drawing readers’ attention to pivotal moments of disconnection and unresolved tension. In **Stanza 1**, the indented line *“    and do not recognize us as we pass”* creates a visual pause, mirroring the familial estrangement caused by the father’s absence. The indentation isolates this line, emphasizing the haunting idea that the family’s routines (symbolized by the “evening doorknobs”) no longer acknowledge their shared identity. This formal choice underscores Lorde’s exploration of memory as both a presence and an absence, where physical spaces fail to validate the speaker’s grief.  

In **Stanza 4/5** (depending on the edition), the line *“    still judgments on familiar things”* is similarly indented, highlighting the father’s lingering influence. The indentation forces a momentary halt, inviting readers to dwell on the tension between his rigid expectations (“well-defined response”) and the speaker’s evolving selfhood. The indentation here becomes a metaphor for the unresolved conflict between the father’s legacy and the speaker’s need to redefine her identity outside his judgments.  

### **Structural Ambiguity and Editorial Choices**  
The poem’s stanza count varies across editions, revealing debates over textual fidelity versus editorial interpretation. In the **Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation edition**, the final lines—*“Lest I go into dust / I have not ever seen my father’s grave”*—are grouped with the preceding stanza (Stanza 4), creating a four-stanza structure. In contrast, the **Google Books excerpt of *The Black Unicorn*** splits these lines into a standalone **Stanza 5**, resulting in five stanzas. This discrepancy arises from differing interpretations of line breaks and thematic divisions:  

| **Edition**               | **Stanza Count** | **Indented Stanzas** | **Key Structural Choice**                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation | 4 stanzas          | 1, 3, 4               | Merges final lines into Stanza 4, emphasizing cyclical repetition of the opening line. |  
| *The Black Unicorn*        | 5 stanzas          | 1, 3, 5               | Separates final lines into Stanza 5, framing the speaker’s unresolved grief as a distinct conclusion. |  

The split in *The Black Unicorn* underscores the poem’s cyclical structure, as the closing lines echo the opening line (*“I have not ever seen my father’s grave”*), creating a loop of unresolved mourning. This editorial choice amplifies the poem’s theme of lingering absence, while the four-stanza version prioritizes thematic cohesion over formal repetition.  

### **Implications for Interpretation and Research**  
The variability in stanza numbering underscores the importance of contextualizing analyses within specific editions. For scholars and students:  
1. **Edition Verification**: Researchers must specify the edition used, as stanza counts and indentation placements directly influence line numbering and thematic interpretations.  
2. **Thematic Consistency**: Despite structural differences, the indentation’s role in emphasizing emotional and ideological shifts remains constant. Whether in Stanza 4 or 5, the line *“still judgments on familiar things”* retains its power to critique inherited expectations.  
3. **Lorde’s Stylistic Intent**: The poem exemplifies Lorde’s belief that form and content are inseparable. Her use of indentation reflects her commitment to “translating silence into language,” as seen in works like *The Cancer Journals*. The visual breaks mirror the fragmentation of memory and identity, aligning with her intersectional lens on race, gender, and family.  

### **Conclusion**  
While the stanza-numbering discrepancy complicates line-by-line analysis, it also invites reflection on the malleability of poetic form. Lorde’s indentation choices are not mere stylistic flourishes but deliberate tools to externalize internal conflicts—between memory and reality, presence and absence, and the self and its inherited legacies. Whether the poem is divided into four or five stanzas, its core message endures: the act of confronting familial and societal silences is both a personal and collective struggle. For readers, this ambiguity becomes a mirror of the poem’s themes, urging engagement with the text’s emotional and structural layers rather than seeking rigid interpretations.  

**Explicit Answer to the User’s Question**:  
- In the **Poetry Out Loud/Poetry Foundation editions**, the indented lines appear in **Stanzas 1, 3, and 4**.  
- In **The Black Unicorn edition**, the same lines are indented but appear in **Stanzas 1, 3, and 5** due to a split in the final stanza.  
- The indentation consistently emphasizes themes of disconnection, maternal displacement, and the father’s lingering authority, regardless of stanza numbering.
