# Which Country Had the Fewest Athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics? (Answer with IOC Code)

# Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a precise title for an article based on the original question: "What country had the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics? If there's a tie, return the first in alphabetical order. Answer with the IOC country code."First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. The title should reflect the main question, which is about identifying the country with the fewest athletes in the 1928 Olympics. If there's a tie, the answer should be the one that comes first alphabetically, and the response should be the IOC code.The user specified to generate a title, so I need to phrase it as a question or statement that clearly states the focus. Since the answer is the IOC code, the title should mention that. Also, including the year (1928) and the event (Summer Olympics) is crucial for specificity.Possible options for the title could be:1. "IOC Country Code for the Nation with the Fewest Athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics"2. "1928 Summer Olympics: Which Country Had the Least Athletes? (IOC Code)"3. "Determining the IOC Code of the Country with the Smallest Athlete Delegation at the 1928 Summer Olympics"But the user wants it precise and direct. The first option is concise and mentions the key elements: IOC code, country, fewest athletes, and the event details. The second one uses a question format but might be a bit wordy. The third is too long. Also, the instruction says to output only the title without extra text, so it must be exact. The original question mentions that in case of a tie, the first alphabetically is chosen. Should that be in the title? Probably not necessary because the title is about the result, not the methodology. The user might just want the main query in the title. Therefore, the best title would be the first option. Let me check again: "IOC Country Code for the Nation with the Fewest Athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics". That includes all required elements without extra details. The tiebreaker is part of the process but not the result's title. So this should be correct.
