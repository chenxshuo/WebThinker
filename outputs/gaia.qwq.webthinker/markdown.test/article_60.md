Question: According to wikipedia, how many Asian countries still have a monarchy and access to the sea in 2021?

# Okay, the user wants a precise title for an article based on the original question: "According to wikipedia, how many Asian countries still have a monarchy and access to the sea in 2021?" Let me break this down.First, the main elements here are Asian countries, monarchy, and access to the sea in 2021. The title needs to clearly reflect all these components. The current article's title isn't provided, so I need to make sure the new title is accurate and concise.I should start with the key question elements. The focus is on the count of countries, so maybe start with "Number of..." Then specify the region: "Asian Countries". Next, the two criteria: "with a Monarchy" and "Access to the Sea". The year 2021 is important for accuracy since political statuses can change. Putting it together: "Number of Asian Countries with a Monarchy and Access to the Sea in 2021 According to Wikipedia". That includes all the key points. Let me check if "According to Wikipedia" should be at the end since the original question mentions that source. Yes, that's necessary for transparency. Is there a better way to phrase it? Maybe "as of 2021" instead of "in 2021", but "in 2021" is straightforward. Also, ensuring that "monarchy" is singular but refers to the presence of a monarchy system. The title should be clear and direct without extra fluff. I think this covers all the requirements. Let me make sure there's no redundancy. Yep, looks good. That should be the precise title.</think>Number of Asian Countries with a Monarchy and Access to the Sea in 2021 According to Wikipedia


Okay, I need to write the "References" section for the research paper based on the user's instructions. The user provided three documents from Wikipedia and some previous analysis. The goal is to list the sources cited in the paper, which include the List of countries in Asia, List of monarchies, and individual country pages from Wikipedia.

First, I should recall the standard citation format for Wikipedia. Typically, it's [Author]. (Year). "Title of the Page". Wikimedia Foundation. URL. But since the user didn't specify URLs, maybe just the basic format is okay. The user mentioned to include the three sources listed in their example: List of countries in Asia, List of monarchies, and individual country pages. 

Wait, the user's example shows three entries. The first two are specific Wikipedia pages, and the third is a general note about country pages. I need to make sure each of these is properly cited. Also, the note mentions that all data is from Wikipedia as of December 2021. 

I should check if the user wants the references in a specific style, like APA or MLA. The example given by the user uses APA style with the contributors as authors and the year. So I'll follow that. 

The first entry is "List of countries in Asia" from Wikipedia. The citation would be:

Wikipedia contributors. (2021). List of countries in Asia. Wikimedia Foundation. 

Second entry is "List of monarchies":

Wikipedia contributors. (2021). List of monarchies. Wikimedia Foundation. 

Third entry is the individual country pages. Since they are multiple, maybe a general citation:

Wikipedia contributors. (2021). Individual country pages accessed via Wikipedia for governance and geography details. Wikimedia Foundation. 

But perhaps it's better to mention that the country-specific data was retrieved from their respective Wikipedia pages. However, listing each country's page would be too lengthy. The user's example uses a general statement, so I'll follow that. 

Also, the note at the end should be included as specified. 

Wait, the user's example includes a note in italics. In the references section, notes are usually placed at the end, maybe as a separate paragraph. 

Putting it all together, the references section should list the three sources with proper formatting, and then the note. Since the user mentioned using markdown tables if possible, but the example they provided doesn't use a table. The user's example uses bullet points. So I'll stick with bullet points for simplicity unless a table adds clarity. 

Alternatively, maybe a table could list each source with title, author, year, and publisher. Let me see:

| Source Title                  | Author              | Year | Publisher          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|------|--------------------|
| List of countries in Asia     | Wikipedia contributors | 2021 | Wikimedia Foundation |
| List of monarchies            | Wikipedia contributors | 2021 | Wikimedia Foundation |
| Individual country pages      | Wikipedia contributors | 2021 | Wikimedia Foundation |

But the third entry is a bit vague. Maybe better to keep it as a bullet list. The user's example uses bullet points, so I'll follow that. 

Also, the note should be italicized. In markdown, that's done with asterisks. 

So the final references section would look like:

## References  
**Sources Cited**:  
- Wikipedia contributors. (2021). *List of countries in Asia*. Wikimedia Foundation.  
- Wikipedia contributors. (2021). *List of monarchies*. Wikimedia Foundation.  
- Wikipedia contributors. (2021). *Individual country pages accessed via Wikipedia for governance and geography details*. Wikimedia Foundation.  

*Note: All data reflects information available on Wikipedia as of December 2021.*

I need to ensure that the titles are italicized as in the example. Also, check for consistency in the formatting. The user's example uses italics for the titles, so I'll apply that. 

Yes, this should meet the user's requirements. No markdown tables are needed here since the information is straightforward. The note is included as specified. All sources are listed properly. I think that's it.
