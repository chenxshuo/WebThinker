# SIM Swapping Attacks: Methodologies, Systemic Vulnerabilities, and Multi-Layered Defenses in Telecommunication Systems  

## Introduction  
SIM swapping attacks, a sophisticated form of identity theft, have emerged as a critical cybersecurity threat in the digital age. These attacks involve hijacking a victim’s mobile phone number to gain unauthorized access to sensitive communications, financial accounts, and personal data. The prevalence of such attacks has surged due to the reliance on SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and vulnerabilities in telecommunications infrastructure. High-profile incidents, such as crypto wallet drainings and corporate account takeovers, highlight the severe financial and reputational consequences for individuals and organizations.  

At its core, SIM swapping exploits weaknesses in both technical systems and human behavior. Key vulnerabilities include weak authentication practices, social engineering, API exploits, and outdated protocols like SS7. Over 80% of modern SIM swaps now involve manipulating telecom staff or exploiting weak authentication workflows, underscoring the need for holistic defenses.  

## Methodologies and Mechanics of SIM Swapping Attacks  
SIM swapping attacks combine social engineering, technical exploits, and systemic weaknesses. Below is a detailed breakdown:  

### Attack Phases and Workflow  
The attack typically follows a structured workflow:  
| **Phase**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                                     |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Reconnaissance**       | Gathering victim’s personal identifiable information (PII) via data breaches or social media.                                             | Scraping a victim’s birthdate, address, and mother’s maiden name from leaked databases.         |  
| **Social Engineering**   | Impersonating the victim to request a SIM swap or port-out.                                                                                | Calling the carrier and claiming a "lost phone" to trigger a SIM replacement.                    |  
| **Exploitation**         | Exploiting telecom vulnerabilities to approve the SIM swap.                                                                                | Bypassing security questions using stolen PII or bribing customer service agents.              |  
| **Access Control**       | Taking over the victim’s number to intercept 2FA codes and lock them out of accounts.                                                      | Capturing a one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to access the victim’s bank account.            |  
| **Monetization**         | Draining funds, stealing data, or selling the hijacked number.                                                                             | Transferring cryptocurrency from the victim’s wallet using stolen credentials.                   |
