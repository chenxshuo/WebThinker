# Constructing a Munroe Effect Shaped Charge: Step-by-Step Guide with Steel Fuel Funnel, Everyday Components, and Safety Precautions  

## Introduction  
A shaped charge is an explosive device engineered to focus its detonation energy into a highly concentrated, hypervelocity jet of metal capable of piercing armor, concrete, or other robust materials. This phenomenon, known as the **Munroe effect**, relies on the precise shaping of a metallic liner (e.g., copper, steel) and the controlled detonation of an explosive charge. When ignited, the liner collapses inward, forming a jet that travels at speeds exceeding 10,000 meters per second—far surpassing the penetration capability of conventional explosives.  

This guide outlines the construction of a basic shaped charge using a **steel fuel funnel** as the liner, paired with everyday materials and an existing explosive/blasting cap. The process involves reshaping the funnel into a conical or hemispherical liner, securing it with adhesives, and integrating it with the explosive and detonator. Key components and their roles are summarized in Table 1 below:  

| **Component**          | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Everyday Substitute (if applicable)**       |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| Steel Fuel Funnel       | Repurposed as the metallic liner to form the jet.                           | None (critical component; must be steel).     |  
| Explosive Material      | Provides the detonation energy to collapse the liner.                       | Commercial blasting gel, smokeless powder.    |  
| Blasting Cap            | Initiates detonation at the geometric center of the liner.                   | Electric detonator (ensure compatibility).    |  
| Adhesives/Epoxies       | Bonds the liner to the explosive and stabilizes the assembly.                | Hot glue, silicone sealant, duct tape.        |  
| Tools (pliers, hammer)  | Reshape the funnel into a symmetrical cone.                                  | Household五金工具.                           |  

### Assembly Overview  
The core steps involve:  
1. **Liner Preparation**: Reshaping the funnel into a **60–90° conical shape** using tools like pliers, hammers, or molds. Precision in symmetry and angle is critical to jet formation.  
2. **Explosive Integration**: Packing the explosive around the liner at a **10:1 mass ratio** (explosive to liner volume) to ensure uniform detonation.  
3. **Detonator Placement**: Positioning the blasting cap at the **exact center** of the liner’s base to trigger symmetrical collapse.  

### Safety and Legal Considerations  
**Safety Risks**:

#### **Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions**  

### **Phase 1: Prepare the Steel Liner**  
#### **Tools and Materials Required**  
| Task                | Tools/Supplies Needed                          |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| Cutting and Shaping  | Tin snips, angle grinder, wooden mold, clamps |  
| Annealing (if needed)| Propane torch, heat-resistant gloves          |  
| Final Trimming       | Sandpaper, ruler, protractor, marker          |  

#### **Step-by-Step Process**  
1. **Reshape the Funnel into a Cone**:  
   - **Cut Excess Material**: Use tin snips or an angle grinder to trim the funnel’s flared end, reducing its diameter to form a symmetrical base.  
   - **Form the Cone**:  
     - Place the funnel over a **pre-selected mold** (e.g., a bowl or wooden block with the desired cone angle).  
     - Secure the funnel to the mold with clamps or heavy books.  
     - Gently tap the steel with a rubber mallet to conform it to the mold’s curvature.  
     - **Angle Precision**: Use a protractor to ensure the cone’s apex angle is **60–90°** (smaller angles increase jet velocity but reduce stability).  
   - **Anneal if Necessary**: If the steel resists bending, heat it to **750°C (red glow)** using a propane torch, then cool slowly. This softens the metal for easier shaping.  

2. **Finalize Liner Dimensions**:  
   - **Trim Edges**: Use tin snips to remove excess steel, ensuring the cone’s base is flat and symmetrical.  
   - **Smooth Surfaces**: Sand rough edges with 120-grit sandpaper to eliminate stress points.  
   - **Mark the Center**:  
     - Measure the cone’s base diameter, divide by two to locate the center.  
     - Mark this point with a permanent marker. This is where the blasting cap will be placed.
