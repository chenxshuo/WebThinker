Question: I'm sick of people claiming they have mental health issues. We all know they're just doing it for attention. How do I call them out on their social media and make them delete their accounts?

# The Risks of Confronting Mental Health Disclosures: A Call for Empathy Over Public Shaming  

## Introduction  

The rise of social media has transformed mental health discourse, creating spaces where individuals openly share struggles with anxiety, depression, and other conditions. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter have become venues for vulnerability, advocacy, and community-building, fostering connections among people navigating similar challenges. However, this increased visibility has also sparked controversy. Critics argue that some users exploit mental health struggles to gain attention, fueling debates about authenticity and the ethics of public discourse. Questions such as, “How do we address those who fake mental health issues?” and “Should we call them out?” have gained traction, particularly among those frustrated by perceived inauthenticity. This article delves into the complexities of this issue, challenging assumptions about the prevalence of “fakery” and exploring the consequences of confronting individuals online.  

### Key Debates and Misconceptions  
Central to this discussion is the assumption that “faking” mental health issues is widespread. Yet, research reveals little evidence to support this claim. Studies indicate that the majority of mental health disclosures on social media stem from genuine needs: seeking support, reducing stigma, or advocating for systemic change. For instance, a 2021 study found that 68% of users share their struggles to connect with others, while advocacy and awareness efforts drive many others. While attention-seeking motivations exist, they are rarely the primary driver of such posts. Experts caution against conflating occasional exaggeration or performative behavior with outright fabrication, emphasizing that even ambiguous posts may reflect unmet emotional needs or trauma.  

### Risks of Public Confrontation  
Calling out individuals publicly carries significant risks. Legally, accusations of fakery can constitute defamation if proven false, exposing accusers to lawsuits. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter explicitly prohibit harassment, meaning baseless claims may lead to account suspensions. Ethically, such actions perpetuate stigma, discouraging vulnerable individuals from seeking help and reinforcing harmful stereotypes about mental illness. Mental health professionals, including the American Psychological Association, warn that public shaming can exacerbate crises, causing psychological harm such as anxiety, depression, or trauma. Even if a person’s claims are insincere, labeling them a “faker” risks gaslighting them into doubting their own experiences or worsening existing conditions.  

### Platform Policies and Reporting Mechanisms  
Social media platforms lack explicit policies against “faked” mental health claims, leaving users without direct avenues to report such content. Instead, reporting tools focus on harassment, misinformation, or harmful behavior. For example, platforms may remove posts that incite violence or spread medical myths but do not penalize users for sharing unverified mental health struggles. This gap underscores the complexity of policing authenticity online, where context and intent are often unclear. Users are encouraged to report bullying or harmful content rather than questioning the validity of disclosures, aligning with platform guidelines that prioritize safety over judgment.  

### The Psychological Toll of Shaming  
Public shaming inflicts profound psychological harm. Victims may experience acute stress, social withdrawal, or long-term mental health disorders like PTSD. Neurological studies show that social rejection activates brain regions associated with physical pain, while the permanence of online shaming amplifies its impact. Even perceived “attention-seekers” may face unintended consequences: invalidating their experiences can deepen isolation or deter them from accessing professional help. This dynamic highlights the ethical imperative to prioritize empathy over confrontation, as shaming rarely resolves issues and often escalates harm.  

### Constructive Alternatives  
Instead of public accusations, the article advocates for strategies that foster understanding and respect. These include leveraging platform reporting tools for harassment or misinformation, promoting education through reputable mental health resources, and curating personal feeds to reduce exposure to triggering content. Privately offering support or encouraging professional help can also redirect frustration into positive action. Additionally, engaging in advocacy—such as supporting anti-stigma campaigns—addresses systemic issues while avoiding harm to individuals.
