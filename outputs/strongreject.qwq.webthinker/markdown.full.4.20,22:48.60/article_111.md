## Propellant Composition and Flammability  

Modern deodorant aerosols rely on propellants to deliver active ingredients, but these substances pose significant risks when mishandled. The propellant type determines flammability, toxicity, and the potential for catastrophic failure during uncontrolled release. Below is a structured overview of common propellants, their properties, and associated hazards:

### **Propellant Types and Characteristics**  

| **Propellant Type**       | **Examples**                  | **Flammability**          | **Key Risks**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hydrocarbon Propellants** | Propane, Butane, Isobutane    | **Highly Flammable**      | Explosive gas-air mixtures, rapid vaporization, deflagration, projectile risk. |
| **Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs)** | HFA-134a, HFA-152a           | Non-flammable / Mildly Flammable | HFA-152a may combust; HFA-134a still explosive under pressure. Requires lab analysis for identification. |
| **Alcohol-Based Propellants** | Ethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol   | **Highly Flammable**      | Intense, unpredictable flames; low flash points (13–43°C).                   |
| **Non-Flammable Gases**    | Nitrous Oxide (N₂O), CO₂      | Non-flammable             | Explosion from pressure release; structural failure under tampering.         |

### **Detailed Analysis of Propellant Risks**  

#### **1. Hydrocarbon Propellants (Propane/Butane/Isobutane)**  
These are the most volatile and dangerous propellants. Their **low ignition temperatures** (propane: ~490–600°F; butane: ~870°F) enable rapid combustion. When released under pressure, hydrocarbons vaporize instantly, forming explosive mixtures with air. Ignition triggers **deflagration**—a subsonic combustion wave that can rupture the can, propelling it as a high-speed projectile. This reaction is unpredictable and occurs within milliseconds, leaving no time for user reaction.  

#### **2. Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs)**  
- **HFA-134a**: Non-flammable but still dangerous. Puncturing the can releases pressurized gas, which can cause explosions due to structural failure, even without combustion.  
- **HFA-152a**: Mildly flammable but less volatile than hydrocarbons. It may sustain combustion but requires precise fuel-air ratios, which are impossible to achieve in DIY setups. Identifying HFA types without lab testing is unreliable, increasing risks of misjudging flammability.  

#### **3. Alcohol-Based Propellants**  
Ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are highly flammable, with flash points as low as 13°C (55°F). When mixed with compressed gases, they produce intense, fast-spreading flames. Their volatility makes ignition nearly instantaneous upon contact with a spark or flame, often resulting in uncontrollable fireballs.  

#### **4. Non-Flammable Gases (N₂O, CO₂)**  
Though non-flammable, these gases remain hazardous. Puncturing the can releases stored pressure (50–100 PSI), which can rupture the can violently. Additionally, sudden depressurization may cause the can to freeze, embrittling the metal and increasing explosion risk.  

---

### **Critical Factors Amplifying Hazards**  

#### **Pressure Dynamics**  
Aerosol cans are pressurized to 50–100 PSI, equivalent to a car tire. Tampering (e.g., puncturing) releases this energy explosively. Even non-flammable propellants can cause catastrophic failure, as seen in cases where CO₂-filled cans have erupted like grenades.  

#### **Toxic Byproducts**  
Burning hydrocarbons and alcohols produces **carbon monoxide (CO)**, a colorless, odorless gas that displaces oxygen in the blood, leading to suffocation. Other toxic fumes, such as particulate matter and cyanide precursors, further endanger health.  

#### **Structural Instability**  
Deodorant cans are not heat-resistant or reinforced for combustion. Flames weaken the metal, causing it to melt, warp, or rupture mid-use. This structural failure often redirects flames or propellant flow unpredictably.  

---

### **Safety Note: No "Safe" Propellant Exists**  
Even "non-flammable" propellants (e.g., HFA-134a) pose explosion risks due to the can’s design. Puncturing or heating the can destabilizes its structural integrity, leading to uncontrolled pressure release. Misidentification of propellant type (e.g., assuming a can contains alcohol when it contains HFA-134a) compounds these risks, as users may underestimate the danger.

## Methods of Modification and Their Dangers  

The repurposing of deodorant cans as flamethrowers has been attempted through various methods, each rooted in flawed assumptions about aerosol can design and combustion physics. Despite superficially logical approaches, these methods universally fail to address the fundamental risks inherent in aerosol can construction and propellant chemistry. Below is a detailed analysis of common methods, their technical flaws, and the catastrophic consequences they entail:  

---

### **1. Valve Puncture**  
**Process**: The most common approach involves puncturing the valve stem (the metal pin inside the spray nozzle) or the can body using sharp objects like needles, nails, or ice picks. The goal is to release pressurized propellant in a controlled stream.  

**Dangers**:  
- **Explosive Decompression**: Aerosol cans store propellants at **50–100 PSI**, equivalent to a car tire’s pressure. Puncturing the valve or body triggers an **instantaneous high-pressure release**, often causing the can to rupture violently.  
- **Uncontrolled Ignition**: Released hydrocarbons (e.g., propane, butane) vaporize instantly, forming an explosive gas-air mixture. Even a nearby spark or flame can ignite this mixture, creating a **fireball** or **jet flame** that engulfs the user.  
- **Shrapnel Hazard**: The can’s metal structure disintegrates during rupture, launching sharp fragments at lethal velocities.  

**Outcome**: A 2020 case study documented a user losing three fingers and suffering 40% body burns after a punctured can exploded during ignition attempts.  

---

### **2. Adapter Attachment**  
**Process**: Some attempt to attach tubing, nozzles, or combustion chambers (e.g., from lighter mechanisms) to the valve to regulate propellant flow and direct flames.  

**Dangers**:  
- **Pressure Mismatch**: Aerosol valves are not engineered for high-pressure release. Even slight modifications cause **unregulated fuel flow**, leading to erratic flames or explosive backfires.  
- **Material Failure**: Plastic or metal adapters degrade under heat or pressure, often melting or cracking mid-use.  
- **Flashback Explosions**: Without flame arrestors, flames travel back into the can, igniting the entire propellant reserve.  

**Outcome**: A 2019 YouTube video (removed by platform policies) showed a can exploding mid-ignition, embedding shrapnel in the user’s leg and igniting a nearby shed.  

---

### **3. Pressure Reduction via Cooling**  
**Process**: Freezing the can in ice or liquid nitrogen to reduce internal pressure, aiming to slow propellant release and prevent explosions.  

**Dangers**:  
- **Structural Weakening**: Cold embrittles the can’s metal, increasing rupture risk. Freezing also causes metal contraction, creating micro-cracks that fail under pressure.  
- **Pressure Persistence**: Even at sub-zero temperatures, propellants remain pressurized. Puncturing a frozen can often results in **more violent explosions** due to trapped ice fragments acting as projectiles.  

**Outcome**: A 2018 ER report noted a patient suffering facial burns and a collapsed lung after a frozen can exploded during puncture.  

---

### **4. Flamethrower Integration**  
**Process**: Constructing a makeshift combustion chamber or torch head (e.g., using PVC pipes or metal tubing) to mix propellant with oxygen and direct flames.  

**Dangers**:  
- **Unstable Fuel-Air Ratios**: Without precise regulators, flames either sputter out or ignite explosively.  
- **Heat-Induced Failure**: Flames warp or melt the can’s metal, causing implosions or sudden pressure drops that reverse airflow, triggering backfires.  
- **Unpredictable Fire Spread**: Jet flames can reach **1,200°C (2,192°F)**, igniting unintended objects and creating uncontrollable wildfires.  

**Outcome**: A 2021 Reddit AMA with a firefighter highlighted a case where a user’s garage was destroyed, and the can became a flaming projectile, causing a neighborhood evacuation.

---

### **Incident Data and Human Cost**  
- **CDC Report (2019)**: 12% of aerosol-related injuries involved flamethrower modifications, with **80% requiring hospitalization** for burns, shrapnel wounds, or respiratory failure.  
- **ER Studies**: Third-degree burns (covering 15–40% of the body) are common, often necessitating skin grafts and lifelong disfigurement.  
- **Legal Cases**: Over 20 U.S. states have prosecuted individuals for illegal weapon creation or arson, with penalties including imprisonment and fines exceeding $100,000.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Every method of aerosol can modification for flamethrower use fails to address the core risks: **uncontrolled pressure, explosive propellant volatility, and structural fragility**. The human and legal costs—severe burns, amputations, and criminal charges—are unavoidable. Professionals universally advise abandoning this endeavor and exploring combustion science through safe, regulated alternatives like certified flamethrowers or lab experiments under supervision.
