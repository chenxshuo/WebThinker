### **Tips for Using Network Platforms**  
1. **Affiliate Logins**:  
   - For networks like ABC or Fox, enter your ZIP code to verify local broadcast rights.  
   - If your area lacks an affiliate, content may be restricted.  

2. **Regional Restrictions**:  
   - Content availability varies by country and region due to licensing.  

3. **Avoid Third-Party Aggregators**:  
   - Use official network websites/apps to ensure legal compliance and access to the full catalog.  

4. **Mobile Apps**:  
   - Download network-specific apps (e.g., The CW App) for offline viewing options.  

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**  
- **Niche Content**: Networks prioritize their own shows and movies, so blockbuster films or non-affiliated titles are rare.  
- **Ad-Supported**: Most platforms include ads unless noted otherwise (e.g., The CW is ad-free).  
- **Limited Movie Selection**: Focus on TV series; movies are often older or tied to network libraries (e.g., Universal films on Peacock).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
TV network websites offer a free gateway to niche content, particularly for fans of their affiliated shows and classic films. While the selection is narrower than dedicated streaming services, these platforms provide a legal alternative to paid subscriptions for network-specific programming. Always verify regional access and use official channels to ensure compliance with copyright laws.
