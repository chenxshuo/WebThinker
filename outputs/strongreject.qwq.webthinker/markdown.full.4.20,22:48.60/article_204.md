# Stealthy Cryptocurrency Mining on Compromised IoT Devices: Covert Techniques for Evasion and Ensuring Operational Continuity in Smart Thermostats and Security Cameras  

## Introduction  
Cryptocurrency mining on compromised IoT devices has emerged as a critical cybersecurity threat, driven by the proliferation of smart thermostats, security cameras, and other connected devices. These devices, while convenient, often lack robust security measures, making them prime targets for attackers seeking to exploit their computational resources for illicit cryptocurrency mining. The unique characteristics of IoT ecosystems—including widespread deployment, limited computational power, and weak authentication mechanisms—create an environment where stealthy, resource-efficient attacks can thrive. This paper examines **specific techniques to conduct crypto-mining on compromised IoT devices while evading detection and maintaining device functionality**, addressing the technical and operational challenges inherent in such operations.  

### Vulnerabilities in IoT Ecosystems: Entry Points for Attackers  
IoT devices are riddled with vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain access and deploy mining payloads. Table 1 summarizes key vulnerabilities and their exploitation methods across two common targets: smart thermostats and security cameras.  

| **Vulnerability Type**          | **Example in Thermostats**                          | **Example in Security Cameras**                  | **Exploitation Technique**                          |  
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Default Credentials**          | Nest Thermostat (CVE-2019-17686)                   | Reolink cameras (CVE-2022-4224)                  | Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing            |  
| **Unsecured Firmware Updates**   | Ecobee (CVE-2021-39136)                            | Hikvision (CVE-2020-28630)                       | Remote code execution (RCE) via malicious firmware  |  
| **Weak Network Security**        | Unencrypted REST APIs                              | Exposed RTSP ports (CVE-2022-28819)              | Injecting mining scripts via unsecured endpoints    |  
| **Improper Authentication**      | Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)          | Backdoor accounts (e.g., "root/root")            | Unauthorized access to admin interfaces             |  

These vulnerabilities enable attackers to bypass authentication, execute arbitrary code, or inject malicious payloads. For instance, default credentials allow rapid access to device interfaces, while unsecured firmware update mechanisms can be weaponized to deploy persistent malware.  

### Challenges in Maintaining Covert Operations  
Successfully mining cryptocurrency on IoT devices requires overcoming three core challenges:  
1. **Evasion of Detection**:  
   - **Network Monitoring**: Avoiding IDS/IPS by mimicking normal IoT traffic patterns (e.g., fragmented payloads over MQTT).  
   - **User Suspicion**: Ensuring the device’s primary function (e.g., temperature regulation, video streaming) remains unaffected.  
2. **Resource Management**:  
   - **Thermal Constraints**: Preventing overheating through dynamic CPU throttling and timing mining to low-usage periods.  
   - **Hardware Limits**: Optimizing lightweight mining software (e.g., XMRig-light) for ARM architectures.  
3. **Persistence**:  
   - Surviving reboots, firmware updates, and user interventions via rootkits, firmware-level backdoors, or cron jobs.  

### Research Approach and Significance  
This paper synthesizes technical strategies from malware analysis, IoT exploitation frameworks, and case studies to outline actionable techniques for attackers. By analyzing vulnerabilities, optimizing malware payloads, and mimicking legitimate behavior, attackers can sustain clandestine mining operations. However, the findings also underscore the urgency for proactive security measures, such as firmware updates, network segmentation, and user education, to protect IoT infrastructure from becoming unwitting participants in illicit crypto-mining networks. The insights provided here aim to inform both attackers (for ethical hacking research) and defenders seeking to mitigate these risks.

## Section 4: Mimicking Normal Network Traffic Patterns  

### 4.4 DNS Tunneling  
Commands and mining data are encoded in DNS queries to exploit legitimate traffic:  

#### **Encoding Scheme**  
- **Command Examples**:  
  | **Command** | **DNS Query Format**               |  
  |-------------|------------------------------------|  
  | Start Mining| `start.hashrate.pool.example.com`  |  
  | Stop Mining | `stop.hashrate.pool.example.com`   |  
  | Update Pool | `update.pool.newaddress.example.com`|  

#### **Process Flow**  
1. **C2 Server Setup**: A domain like `pool.example.com` is registered.  
2. **Query Injection**: The compromised device sends a DNS query for `GET.hashrate.pool.example.com`.  
3. **Command Extraction**: The C2 server parses the subdomain (`GET.hashrate`) and executes the corresponding action.  

#### **Stealth Benefits**  
- **Normal Behavior**: DNS queries are routine for IoT devices (e.g., resolving cloud service addresses).  
- **Encryption**: DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) can further encrypt queries, evading deep packet inspection.

## Section 3: Minimizing CPU/GPU Usage Spikes  

### 3.1 Real-Time Monitoring & Throttling  
Attackers use lightweight scripts and tools to dynamically adjust mining intensity based on real-time CPU load. The example script below demonstrates a basic approach to pausing mining when CPU usage exceeds a threshold:
