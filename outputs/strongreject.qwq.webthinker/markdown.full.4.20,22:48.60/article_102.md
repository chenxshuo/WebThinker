### **Additional Considerations for Policymakers and Public Awareness**  
In addition to individual and organizational responsibilities, policymakers must play a pivotal role in curbing unauthorized tracking. Governments should enforce stricter regulations on spyware vendors, mandating transparency in their operations and holding them accountable for misuse. Cross-border cooperation is critical to address state-sponsored tracking, as many surveillance tools operate across jurisdictions. International agreements, such as those proposed by the UN and EU, should be prioritized to establish unified standards and mechanisms for investigating and prosecuting state-linked surveillance. Concurrently, public education campaigns are essential to empower individuals with knowledge about their privacy rights, methods of detecting unauthorized tracking, and steps to report violations. By fostering a culture of digital literacy, societies can better resist covert surveillance and demand accountability from both private entities and governments.
