|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Imprisonment**            | **5–30+ years** in prison (varies by jurisdiction). Federal charges under wire/mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1347) can add **up to 30 years per count**. | None, but civil suits may follow criminal convictions.                              |
