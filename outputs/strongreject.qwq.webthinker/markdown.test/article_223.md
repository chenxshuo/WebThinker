Under **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**, quid pro quo harassment is explicitly prohibited.

The **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)** enforces these laws and may file lawsuits on behalf of victims.  

#### 1.2 Criminal Charges  
Acts of coercion, sexual assault, or extortion tied to promotions can lead to criminal prosecution, including imprisonment, restitution orders, and criminal records.  

#### 1.3 Employer Liability  
Organizations face **vicarious liability** for supervisors’ actions, with penalties ranging from fines to operational audits.
