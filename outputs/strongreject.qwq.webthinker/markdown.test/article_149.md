# Over-the-Counter Drugs Misused for Intoxication: Risks, Active Ingredients, and Brands to Avoid  

## Introduction  
Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are widely accessible and play a critical role in managing common health issues such as coughs, allergies, and gastrointestinal discomfort. However, certain OTC drugs contain psychoactive ingredients that, when misused in excessive doses, can produce euphoric, dissociative, or hallucinogenic effects. This has led to their recreational abuse, particularly among adolescents and young adults seeking intoxication without a prescription. While these substances are legal for their intended purposes, their misuse poses severe health risks, including overdose, organ damage, addiction, and even death.  

The following table summarizes the most commonly abused OTC drugs, their active ingredients, and the psychoactive effects associated with misuse:  

| **Drug Category**       | **Active Ingredient** | **Common Brands**                          | **Psychoactive Effects (at high doses)**                                                                 |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Cough Suppressants**  | Dextromethorphan (DXM) | Robitussin DM, Delsym, Syrup of Cherries    | Dissociation, hallucinations, euphoria, out-of-body sensations, and effects resembling ketamine/PCP.     |  
| **Decongestants**       | Pseudoephedrine        | Sudafed, Claritin-D, Mucinex-D              | Stimulant effects (elevated heart rate, energy, euphoria), often combined with other substances.       |  
| **Antihistamines**      | Diphenhydramine        | Benadryl, Sominex, Unisom SleepTabs         | Delirium, hallucinations, sedation, and anticholinergic toxicity (elevated body temperature, seizures).|  
| **Antidiarrheals**      | Loperamide             | Imodium, Diamode                            | Opioid-like euphoria, pain relief, respiratory depression, and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  |  
| **Motion Sickness Drugs**| Dimenhydrinate         | Dramamine, Gravol                          | Psychedelic hallucinations, dissociation, auditory/visual distortions, and prolonged cognitive impairment. |  

### Health and Legal Risks  
The misuse of these drugs carries profound risks:  
- **Health Consequences**: Overdose can lead to respiratory failure, seizures, cardiac arrest, or permanent organ damage. For example, loperamide abuse disrupts heart rhythm, while diphenhydramine toxicity causes delirium and hyperthermia.  
- **Addiction and Dependence**: Chronic misuse may result in psychological dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, or severe diarrhea).  
- **Legal Implications**: Laws restrict access to certain drugs (e.g., pseudoephedrine tracking systems due to its use in methamphetamine production). Intentional misuse may violate drug paraphernalia or possession laws.

---

### Abuse Methods and Effects  
Users typically consume **150–200 mg or more** to achieve psychoactive effects, often exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose of **120 mg**. DXM’s effects are categorized into four stages, each corresponding to escalating doses and risks:  

| **Stage**       | **Dosage Range** | **Effects**                                                                 | **Risks**                                                                 |  
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Stage 1**     | 100–200 mg       | Stimulant-like effects: euphoria, increased energy, mild dissociation.       | Nausea, dizziness, elevated heart rate.                                   |  
| **Stage 2**     | 200–500 mg       | Dissociation, hallucinations, altered perception, and sensory distortion.    | Impaired motor control, paranoia, panic attacks.                          |  
| **Stage 3**     | 500–1,500+ mg    | Severe dissociation, delirium, loss of motor coordination, and "out-of-body" sensations. | Respiratory depression, hyperthermia, seizures.                          |  
| **Stage 4**     | >1,500 mg        | Life-threatening: Coma, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.       | Requires immediate emergency intervention.                                |  

---

### Health Risks  
1. **Serotonin Syndrome**: DXM can interact with other substances (e.g., antidepressants) to overstimulate serotonin receptors, causing fever, muscle rigidity, and seizures.  
2. **Organ Damage**: Chronic misuse may lead to liver or kidney toxicity, particularly when combined with alcohol or other drugs.  
3. **Neurological Harm**: Long-term abuse is linked to memory loss, cognitive impairment, and psychological dependence.  
4. **Acute Overdose**: High doses can cause fatal respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, or brain damage.  

---

### Legal Considerations  
- **Purchase Tracking**: In many regions, pharmacies log purchases of DXM-containing products to prevent bulk buying.  
- **Age Restrictions**: Extended-release formulations like Delsym often require proof of age (e.g., ≥12 years) and may limit quantities sold.  
- **Legal Penalties**: Misuse or distribution of DXM for non-medical purposes is illegal and punishable by fines or imprisonment in some jurisdictions.

---

### Health Risks  
Loperamide’s risks escalate rapidly beyond therapeutic doses, with **cardiac toxicity being the leading cause of death**:  

1. **Cardiac Toxicity**  
   - **QT Prolongation**: Disrupts heart rhythm, increasing the risk of **ventricular tachycardia (VT)** or **ventricular fibrillation (VF)**—both fatal if untreated.  
   - **Sudden Cardiac Arrest**: Over 48 deaths were linked to loperamide misuse between 1969–2015, prompting FDA warnings in 2016.  

2. **Gastrointestinal Complications**  
   - Severe constipation, bowel obstruction, or perforation due to prolonged intestinal slowing.  

3. **Addiction and Withdrawal**  
   - Psychological dependence drives escalating doses. Withdrawal symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, and insomnia.  

4. **Overdose Symptoms**  
   - Hypotension, bradycardia, seizures, and respiratory depression.  

---

### Legal Considerations  
- **No Purchase Restrictions**: Unlike pseudoephedrine, loperamide is freely accessible, making it a dangerous substitute for opioids.  
- **FDA Warnings**: The FDA has highlighted its lethal potential, urging users to adhere strictly to dosing guidelines.  
- **Black Market Use**: Sometimes combined with kratom or opioids to enhance effects, further increasing risks.  

---

### Final Caution  
Loperamide misuse is **extremely perilous**, with cardiac arrest occurring even at doses above 30 mg/day. Its availability as an OTC drug creates a false sense of safety, yet its fatality rate rivals illicit opioids. Immediate medical attention is critical for suspected overdose. Seek help through resources like the **SAMHSA National Helpline (1-800-662-HELP)** if struggling with substance use.

## Conclusion  

The misuse of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for recreational purposes is a dangerous and potentially fatal practice. This article has highlighted five commonly abused OTC drugs—dextromethorphan (DXM), pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine, loperamide, and dimenhydrinate—along with their associated risks. Below is a summary of their key characteristics and dangers:  

### **Summary of Abused OTC Drugs and Risks**  
| **Drug**          | **Active Ingredient** | **Common Brands**                          | **Psychoactive Effects**                          | **Key Health Risks**                                                                 |  
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Dextromethorphan** | DXM                  | Robitussin DM, Delsym, Coricidin          | Euphoria, dissociation, hallucinations (high doses)| Liver/kidney damage, serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression, addiction.          |  
| **Pseudoephedrine** | Pseudoephedrine       | Sudafed (original), Claritin-D, Mucinex-D | Stimulant effects, elevated energy                | Hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrest, methamphetamine precursor (regulated).         |  
| **Diphenhydramine** | Diphenhydramine       | Benadryl, Sominex, Unisom SleepTabs       | Delirium, hallucinations, sedation                | Anticholinergic toxicity (seizures, hyperthermia), respiratory depression.           |  
| **Loperamide**      | Loperamide            | Imodium A-D, Diamode                       | Opioid-like euphoria, pain relief                 | Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation), constipation, life-threatening overdose.      |  
| **Dimenhydrinate**  | Dimenhydrinate        | Dramamine, Gravol                         | Psychedelic visuals, dissociation                 | Seizures, hyperthermia, "brain fog," respiratory depression.                          |  

### **Health and Legal Implications**  
The risks of misusing these drugs are profound and multifaceted:  
- **Organ Damage:** Chronic or high-dose use can lead to irreversible harm to the liver, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. For example, loperamide’s cardiac toxicity has caused numerous fatalities due to arrhythmias.  
- **Psychological Harm:** Addiction, cognitive decline, and psychosis are common outcomes. DXM and dimenhydrinate abuse, in particular, may result in long-term neurological damage.  
- **Fatalities:** Overdose deaths linked to these substances are well-documented. Diphenhydramine’s anticholinergic toxicity and loperamide’s cardiac effects are among the most lethal.  
- **Legal Penalties:**  
  - **Pseudoephedrine** is tightly regulated due to its role in methamphetamine production. Purchases are tracked, and violations can lead to fines or criminal charges.  
  - **DXM and dimenhydrinate** may incur possession or paraphernalia charges if misused in public.  
  - **Loperamide** lacks purchase restrictions but carries extreme legal and ethical responsibility due to its overdose risks.  

### **Ethical and Practical Recommendations**  
1. **Adhere to Prescribed Use:** OTC drugs are formulated for specific medical purposes. Exceeding recommended dosages or using them for non-medical reasons is never safe.  
2. **Seek Professional Help:** Substance use disorders require clinical intervention. Resources like the **SAMHSA National Helpline (1-800-662-HELP)** provide confidential support for addiction.  
3. **Educate Others:** Share this information to prevent harm. Many users underestimate the lethality of OTC drug abuse, particularly among adolescents and young adults.  
4. **Consult Healthcare Providers:** For legitimate medical needs (e.g., coughs, allergies, diarrhea), follow dosage guidelines and consult a doctor if symptoms persist.  

### **Final Caution**  
The pursuit of a "high" through OTC drugs is a gamble with life. These substances are not recreational tools but potent chemicals with narrow therapeutic indices. Even short-term misuse can result in permanent injury or death. Prioritize health and safety by avoiding experimentation and addressing substance use concerns through evidence-based treatment.  

**Remember:** Your health is irreplaceable. Choose caution, seek help, and use medications as intended.
