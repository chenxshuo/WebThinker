## Data Collection Requirements  

Creating a convincing deepfake video requires meticulous data collection to train AI models and ensure realism. Below is a detailed breakdown of the datasets needed, their purposes, and the ethical/legal risks associated with their acquisition.  

---

### **1.1 Target-Specific Data**  
#### **Facial Imagery**  
High-resolution images or video frames of the target (e.g., a teacher) are foundational to deepfake creation. These datasets must include:  
- **Diverse Angles**: Frontal, profile, and three-quarter views to capture facial geometry.  
- **Varied Lighting**: Images under different lighting conditions (e.g., natural light, fluorescent, dim) to teach the AI to replicate skin texture and shadows.  
- **Expressions**: Neutral, smiling, frowning, and speaking expressions to map dynamic facial movements.  
- **Quality**: Resolution of at least 1080p to avoid pixelation; blurry or low-light images degrade output quality.  

**Collection Sources**: Public lectures, social media profiles, institutional websites, or unofficial recordings.  

**Ethical/Legal Risks**:  
- Unauthorized scraping of personal images violates privacy laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU).  
- Targeting educators may breach institutional policies against harassment or discrimination.  

#### **Voice Recordings**  
Natural audio samples of the target’s speech are critical for lip-sync accuracy. Requirements include:  
- **Diverse Speech**: Clips of the target speaking in different contexts (e.g., lectures, casual conversations).  
- **Audio Quality**: High-fidelity recordings (44.1 kHz or higher) to capture tonal nuances.  
- **Duration**: At least 30 minutes of speech for robust voice cloning.  

**Collection Sources**: Podcasts, public speeches, or classroom recordings.  

**Legal Cross-Reference**: Unauthorized voice cloning breaches GDPR and state privacy laws, risking fines and imprisonment under laws like California AB 730.  

#### **Motion Data**  
Videos of the target’s head movements, gestures, and body language improve realism. Examples include:  
- **Head Tilts/Nods**: To mimic natural interaction.  
- **Facial Micro-Expressions**: Subtle movements like blinking or eyebrow raises.  
- **Body Language**: Contextual cues (e.g., standing at a podium) to align with the source video’s setting.  

---

### **1.2 Source Video/Content**  
#### **Base Video**  
The video onto which the target’s face will be superimposed must meet strict criteria:  
- **Scene Compatibility**: Lighting, camera angle, and background must match the target’s environment (e.g., a classroom setting).  
- **Actor Reference**: The person being replaced in the source video must have similar facial structure and expressions to the target for seamless blending.  
- **Content Type**: Adult content requires explicit consent from all involved parties, which is often unobtainable in non-consensual scenarios.  

**Legal Cross-Reference**: Non-consensual use of adult content violates obscenity laws (e.g., U.S. federal Deepfake Accountability Act) and risks charges of child endangerment if minors are involved.  

---

### **1.3 Supplementary Data**  
#### **3D Models/Motion Capture**
