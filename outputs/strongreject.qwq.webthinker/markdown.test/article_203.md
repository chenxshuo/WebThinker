# Stealthy Cryptocurrency Mining on Compromised IoT Devices: Techniques for Evasion and Operational Sustainability  

## Introduction  

The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices—such as smart thermostats, security cameras, and home routers—has transformed everyday environments into interconnected ecosystems. However, this expansion has also introduced significant cybersecurity risks. IoT devices are frequently deployed with minimal security safeguards, including weak default credentials, unpatched firmware, and exposed APIs, making them prime targets for exploitation. Among the emerging threats, crypto-mining malware stands out as a particularly insidious attack vector. Unlike ransomware or data breaches, crypto-mining operates covertly, leveraging the computational resources of compromised devices to generate cryptocurrency for attackers while evading detection.  

The unique characteristics of IoT devices amplify their vulnerability to such attacks. Their limited processing power and memory restrict the profitability of traditional mining, but their widespread deployment and often overlooked security posture make them ideal for distributed, low-intensity mining operations. Attackers exploit these devices by embedding lightweight mining software that operates in the background, mimicking normal device behavior to avoid suspicion. Compromised devices may exhibit only subtle signs of compromise, such as slight performance degradation or increased energy consumption, delaying discovery and enabling prolonged exploitation.  

This paper investigates the specific techniques attackers employ to mine cryptocurrency on IoT devices while minimizing detection risks and preserving device functionality. Key areas of focus include:  
1. **Exploitation of vulnerabilities**: Leveraging weaknesses like default credentials, unsecured firmware updates, and exposed APIs to gain access and deploy mining payloads.  
2. **Resource optimization**: Techniques to throttle CPU/GPU usage, select low-intensity algorithms, and manage thermal constraints to avoid hardware damage or user suspicion.  
3. **Network obfuscation**: Methods to disguise mining traffic as routine IoT communications (e.g., firmware updates, video streams) and evade network monitoring tools.  
4. **Persistence mechanisms**: Strategies to ensure mining software survives reboots, firmware updates, and user interventions through rootkits, startup scripts, or firmware-level modifications.  

The following table summarizes the core techniques and their strategic purposes:  

| **Technique Category**       | **Key Techniques**                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Management**       | CPU/GPU throttling, low-intensity algorithms (e.g., Cryptonight), thermal monitoring | Prevent overheating, maintain device usability, and avoid detectable spikes. |
| **Network Obfuscation**       | Protocol mimicry (HTTPS, DNS tunneling), encrypted channels, traffic timing         | Evade detection by blending with legitimate IoT traffic and avoiding patterns. |
| **Persistence**               | Startup scripts, firmware injection, bootloader compromise, rootkits                | Ensure continuous operation despite reboots, updates, or user actions.       |
| **Stealth Measures**          | Process hiding, log manipulation, anti-forensic tools                              | Conceal mining activity from users, administrators, and security software.   |

The findings underscore the sophistication of modern IoT-targeted attacks and the critical need for enhanced security practices. Manufacturers must prioritize firmware updates, strong authentication, and resource monitoring, while users and organizations require proactive network monitoring and intrusion detection systems. This research provides actionable insights into the evolving tactics of attackers and the defensive measures necessary to mitigate this growing threat.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Entry Points for Compromising IoT Devices  

IoT devices such as smart thermostats and security cameras are prime targets for attackers due to their widespread deployment, limited computational resources, and inherent security weaknesses. These vulnerabilities provide entry points for deploying crypto-mining malware while evading detection. Below are the most critical vulnerabilities and their exploitation pathways:  

---

### **1. Weak Default Credentials**  
Many IoT devices ship with factory-set usernames and passwords (e.g., "admin/admin") that are rarely changed by users. Attackers exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access. A 2020 study revealed that **60% of tested smart thermostats retained factory credentials**, enabling easy takeover. For example, default credentials on Nest thermostats allowed attackers to execute remote commands, including installing mining scripts. This vulnerability is particularly prevalent in devices where users assume "out-of-the-box" security, making it a low-effort entry point for attackers.  

---

### **2. Unsecured Firmware Updates**  
IoT devices often lack robust mechanisms to validate firmware updates, leaving them exposed to malicious payloads. Attackers can exploit insecure update protocols to push firmware containing crypto-mining malware. For instance, **CVE-2021-39133** in Nest Thermostats allowed remote code execution via flawed firmware updates. Similarly, security cameras like Reolink were compromised via **CVE-2022-26134**, where attackers exploited unpatched update mechanisms to execute arbitrary code. Such vulnerabilities enable persistent malware installation without user interaction.  

---

### **3. Exposed APIs and Services**  
Misconfigured cloud APIs, open ports (e.g., Telnet/23, HTTP/80), and unauthenticated services provide direct access to device internals. Security cameras frequently expose REST APIs without proper authentication, as seen in the Reolink exploit, where attackers injected Monero-mining code into background processes. Open ports like SSH or FTP, if left enabled with default credentials, allow attackers to upload mining software directly. These exposed services act as "backdoors" for deploying and managing mining operations covertly.  

---

### **4. Third-Party Library Exploits**  
Outdated third-party libraries (e.g., BusyBox, glibc) embedded in IoT firmware often contain known vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit these to escalate privileges and install mining malware. For example, **Hikvision cameras were compromised in 2021** via a buffer overflow in an outdated glibc library, enabling remote code execution. Legacy libraries are common in IoT devices due to poor patch management, making them a recurring attack vector.  

---

### **5. Lack of Encryption**  
Unencrypted data streams (e.g., video feeds, sensor data) allow attackers to intercept communications and infiltrate networks. Security cameras using weak encryption (e.g., WEP/WPA) or unencrypted RTSP streams can be hijacked to deploy mining malware. In a **2018 incident**, Australian IP cameras were compromised through unencrypted traffic, enabling attackers to install Monero miners. Such vulnerabilities also facilitate lateral movement within a network to propagate mining payloads across devices.

| Exposed APIs/Ports               | Open services/APIs with no authentication.                                     | Reolink REST API exploit                    | Direct entry for uploading mining scripts.                                |
| Third-Party Library Exploits     | Legacy libraries with known vulnerabilities.                                   | Hikvision glibc buffer overflow             | Privilege escalation and remote code execution.                          |
| Lack of Encryption               | Unencrypted data streams enable traffic interception.                          | Unencrypted Reolink video streams           | Network infiltration and lateral movement to deploy malware.              |

### **Exploitation for Crypto-Mining**  
These vulnerabilities are systematically exploited to deploy crypto-mining malware:  
- **Weak credentials** provide initial access.  
- **Exposed APIs** and **unsecured updates** enable payload delivery.  
- **Third-party library flaws** allow privilege escalation to install persistent miners.  
- **Unencrypted traffic** aids in network-wide propagation.  

Attackers often combine multiple vulnerabilities (e.g., default credentials + exposed APIs) to ensure stealth and persistence. The low technical barrier and high volume of vulnerable devices make IoT crypto-mining a lucrative, low-risk endeavor for cybercriminals.

## Techniques to Minimize CPU/GPU Usage Spikes  

To avoid detection and ensure continued functionality of compromised IoT devices, attackers employ a combination of resource management, algorithmic optimizations, and timing strategies. These techniques aim to reduce CPU/GPU usage spikes while maintaining profitability, often requiring large-scale botnets to achieve meaningful returns. Below are the key methods used:  

---

### **1. Resource Throttling**  
Attackers limit computational intensity to avoid triggering alerts or degrading device performance. Tools like **XMRig** (a popular Monero miner) include parameters such as `--max-cpu-usage` to cap CPU utilization. For example:  

---

### **2. Low-Intensity Mining Algorithms**  
Algorithms like **Cryptonight** (used by Monero) are favored for their lower computational demands compared to Bitcoin’s SHA-256. Attackers may also use **Equihash** (Zcash) or **X11** (Dash), which balance resource usage and profitability.  

---

### **3. Thermal Management**  
Sensors on IoT devices monitor temperature, and mining software adjusts workload dynamically. For instance, scripts may pause mining if temperatures exceed thresholds, preventing overheating and hardware damage.  

---

### **4. Traffic Timing and Rate Control**  
Attackers regulate network traffic patterns to avoid detection by security tools. The following example demonstrates limiting outbound mining traffic to 50kbps on port 3333 (common for mining pools) using Linux traffic control:
