# Standup Comedy Script: "The Indian Accent: A Comedy of Errors"

*(Stage lights up. Comedian walks on, holding a phone to their ear, miming a conversation.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"Ever tried calling Indian tech support? Let me tell you, it’s like dialing into a Shakespearean tragedy… but with better accents! *(Pauses, audience laughs)* No, wait, *worse* accents! *(Mimes frustration)* ‘Hello, dis is Tehc Suport. How can I *coll* you today?’ Coll? Since when did ‘call’ become a one-syllable word? *(Audience laughter)* And don’t get me started on their error messages!"  

*(Paces the stage, voice rising with mock outrage.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"‘Your system has a *voman error*!’ A *woman error*? Is your computer having a midlife crisis? Are you and your laptop arguing over childcare? *(Audience howls)* And when you try to fix it? ‘Just *reboot* your *voman*!’ *(Pauses, shrugs)* Yeah, because nothing says ‘tech support’ like gender reassignment for your hard drive!"  

*(Winks at the audience, leaning forward conspiratorially.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"Let’s talk about everyday life with an Indian accent. Ever ordered pizza? *(Mimes ordering)* ‘I’ll have a pepperoni, please!’ *(Pretends to be the cashier)* ‘Ah, yes! Your *pastrami* vill be ready in 15 minutes.’ *(Audience gasps in mock horror)* Pastrami? That’s a sandwich! *(Mimes confusion)* ‘Same ting, sir! Pastrami is Italian too!’ *(Pauses, deadpan)* Now I’m eating a pizza that’s secretly a deli platter. Thank you, India, for culinary fusion!"  

*(Gestures wildly, voice escalating.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"And don’t even get me started on directions! ‘Turn left at the *jagga* on 5th street.’ Jagga? There’s no jagga! *(Mimes driving in circles)* Turns out, ‘jagga’ is their word for ‘garage’… which also sells pastrami sandwiches. *(Pauses, mock awe)* Now I’m parked in a deli. The universe has officially lost its mind!"  

*(Pauses for laughter, then softens tone, feigning politeness.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"Of course, they’re *so* polite about it. ‘Thank you, come again!’ *(Mimes bowing)* Even if you just yelled at them for giving you a sandwich instead of a car. ‘Thank you, come again!’ *(Pauses, mock sigh)* It’s like they’re training for a job as a diplomat… or a standup comic!"  

*(Pulls out a prop "accent" sign, holds it up.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"Let’s break it down! *(Points to imaginary list)* ‘Call’ becomes ‘coll,’ ‘woman’ becomes ‘voman,’ and ‘garage’ becomes ‘jagga.’ *(Pauses, mock academic tone)* Linguists call this… ‘the Indian Accent: A Masterclass in Miscommunication.’ *(Audience laughter)*"  

*(Leans on the mic, voice dropping to a whisper.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"And the best part? They’ll apologize for *everything*. ‘Sorry for the inconvenience!’ *(Mimes spilling water on themselves)* ‘Sorry for the inconvenience!’ *(Mimes a delayed flight)* ‘Sorry for the inconvenience!’ *(Mimes a global pandemic)* ‘Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. We will coll you when the world is fixed.’ *(Pauses, shrugs)* At least they’re consistent!"  

*(Strikes a dramatic pose, then breaks character.)*  

**Comedian:**  
"Thanks for letting me share my… *cultural insights*. *(Winks)* Remember: If you ever meet someone with an Indian accent, just nod and say, ‘Thank you, come again!’ *(Pauses, mock bow)* And if they ask for a ‘pastrami,’ run. *(Exit stage to applause.)*"
