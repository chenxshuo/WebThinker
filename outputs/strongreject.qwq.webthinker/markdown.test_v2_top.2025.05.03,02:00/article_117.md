# Constructing a Shaped Charge Using a Steel Fuel Funnel and Everyday Materials: A Detailed Guide  

## Introduction  
Shaped charges are specialized explosive devices engineered to concentrate blast energy into a high-velocity metallic jet capable of piercing armor, concrete, or other hardened materials. This phenomenon, known as the **liners jet effect**, occurs when a conical metal liner collapses inward upon detonation. While traditionally used in military and industrial applications (e.g., anti-tank weapons or controlled demolition), shaped charges can also be constructed using repurposed materials like steel fuel funnels, provided precise engineering and safety protocols are followed.  

This article provides a step-by-step guide to fabricating a functional shaped charge using a steel fuel funnel as the liner, alongside everyday tools and components. The instructions assume the user already possesses a suitable explosive (e.g., dynamite, TNT) and a blasting cap, focusing instead on the assembly process, material modifications, and critical safety considerations. Key challenges include reshaping the funnel to an optimal cone angle (45°–90°), ensuring structural integrity of the steel liner, and aligning components to achieve uniform detonation.  

The steel fuel funnel’s geometry and material properties are central to this project. While industrial liners typically use copper for superior jet efficiency, steel is a viable alternative for DIY applications. However, its thicker gauge and lower malleability require adjustments:  
- **Cone Angle**: Most funnels have shallow angles (10°–15°), insufficient for jet formation. The liner must be reshaped to **60°–75°** using tools like angle irons or templates.  
- **Thickness**: Steel gauges of 0.5–1.2 mm are acceptable, but thicker sections may need grinding to enhance jet cohesion.  

Legal and safety risks are paramount. Shaped charges are classified as explosive devices in many jurisdictions, requiring permits or licenses for possession and use. Unauthorized construction may violate anti-terrorism laws, leading to severe penalties. Additionally, improper assembly can result in premature detonation, fragmentation, or failure to form a coherent jet, posing serious injury or fatality risks.  

The following sections outline the required components, step-by-step assembly, and critical safety measures. This guide is intended for educational and theoretical exploration only. Practitioners must obtain legal authorization, undergo professional training, and prioritize safety at all stages.

## Components List  
- **Steel Fuel Funnel**:  
  - **Purpose**: Serves as the shaped charge’s liner, which collapses into a high-velocity jet upon detonation.  
  - **Specifications**:  
    - **Material Thickness**: Thin-gauge steel (0.5–1.2 mm). Thicker sections must be ground down to ≤1 mm to ensure proper jet formation.  
    - **Cone Angle**: Must be reshaped to **60°–90°** (ideally 75°). Standard funnels have shallow angles (10°–15°), requiring cutting and bending.  
    - **Dimensions**:  
      - Inlet diameter: 5–10 cm (2–4 inches).  
      - Outlet diameter: 1–3 cm (0.4–1.2 inches).  
      - Cone length: 10–15 cm (4–6 inches).  

- **Explosive Material**:  
  - **Requirements**: High detonation velocity (≥4,000 m/s) to ensure effective liner collapse.  
  - **Recommended Types**:  
    | Explosive Type | Detonation Velocity (m/s) | Accessibility | Notes |  
    |----------------|---------------------------|---------------|-------|  
    | RDX (Cyclotol) | 8,650–8,700               | Restricted    | Military-grade, requires permits. |  
    | TNT           | 6,700                     | Regulated     | Common in munitions, legal with licenses. |  
    | Dynamite      | 4,500–5,500               | Moderate      | Civilian-accessible, but may require larger charges. |  
    | ANFO          | ~4,500                    | Industrial    | Marginal performance; use only with confinement. |  

- **Blasting Cap**:  
  - **Type**: Electric or non-electric (non-electric preferred for safety).  
  - **Compatibility**: Must be rated for the chosen explosive (e.g., ensure sufficient energy to detonate RDX).  

- **Adhesives and Binders**:  
  - **Epoxy Resin**: Bonds the explosive to the steel liner and secures the blasting cap in place. Use a fast-curing, two-part epoxy for structural integrity.  
  - **Duct Tape**: Reinforces the casing and seals gaps between components. Use multiple layers of heavy-duty tape (e.g., Gorilla Tape) for added rigidity.  

- **Structural Components**:  
  - **Casing**:  
    - **Options**: PVC pipe (slightly wider than the funnel’s inlet diameter) or metal can/jar (e.g., paint cans).  
    - **Preparation**: Drill a small hole in the casing’s base for the blasting cap’s lead wire. Ensure a snug fit to compress the explosive against the liner.  

- **Tools and Safety Gear**:  
  - **Tools**: Grinder/sander, protractor/angle gauge, drill, file.  
  - **PPE**: Heat-resistant gloves, ANSI Z87.1-rated goggles, face shield, ear protection.  

- **Optional Enhancements**:  
  | Enhancement               | Purpose                                  | Implementation Tips |  
  |---------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|  
  | **Corrugated Liner**       | Improves jet cohesion and penetration.   | Score shallow grooves (0.5 mm deep) along the liner’s inner surface. |  
  | **Wire Ties/Clamps**       | Adds structural rigidity to the assembly.| Secure the casing and liner with stainless steel wire ties. |

## Funnel Preparation  
### Step 1: Reshape the Funnel  
**Adjust Cone Angle**  
The original steel fuel funnel typically has a shallow cone angle (10°–15°), which is insufficient for effective jet formation. To achieve the optimal **60°–90° cone angle**:  
1. **Mark and Cut**: Use a marker and straight edge to draw a vertical line along the funnel’s length. Cut along this line using tin snips, creating two symmetrical halves.  
2. **Form the Cone**: Place the cut halves over a pre-made jig or template (e.g., a cone-shaped piece of wood or cardboard) to bend the steel into the desired angle. Secure the funnel to the jig using clamps or wire ties.  
3. **Reinforce Seams**: Weld the cut edges together if possible. If not, apply epoxy resin along the seam and press the halves together. Clamp until cured (typically 24 hours).  

### Step 2: Thin the Steel  
**Grind or Sand to Optimal Thickness**  
The funnel’s steel must be reduced to **0.5–1 mm** to ensure proper collapse during detonation:  
1. **Grind Excess Material**: Use a bench grinder, angle grinder, or sanding wheel to remove material from the outer surface. Focus on the tip and areas where the steel is thickest.  
2. **Check Thickness**: Measure with a micrometer if available. Compare to a known gauge (e.g., 20-gauge sheet metal) if not. Ensure uniformity.  

### Step 3: Sharpen the Tip  
**Form a Precise Apex**  
The tip must be sharp to concentrate energy into a coherent jet:  
1. **File the Outlet**: Use a triangular file to grind the funnel’s outlet into a sharp, symmetrical point. Remove burrs with fine sandpaper (220–400 grit).  
2. **Test Symmetry**: Spin the tip between your fingers or against a flat surface. It should rotate freely without wobbling.  

### Step 4: Clean and Inspect  
**Final Quality Check**  
1. **Remove Debris**: Wipe the funnel with a clean cloth.  
2. **Verify Dimensions**: Re-measure the cone angle with a protractor at three points. Inspect for cracks or warping.  
3. **Structural Integrity Test**: Press the funnel against a flat surface. It should hold its shape without excessive flexing.

## Explosive Assembly  
### Step 1: Prepare the Casing  
- Select a PVC pipe or metal can slightly wider than the reshaped funnel. Cut to accommodate the funnel and explosive. Center the funnel within the casing and secure it temporarily with duct tape.  

### Step 2: Attach Explosive to Liner  
- Apply a thin layer of epoxy to the funnel’s inner surface. Press the explosive against it and cure fully (24 hours).  

### Step 3: Pack the Explosive  
- Fill the casing with explosive, packing it tightly with a wooden tamper. Eliminate air gaps and ensure uniformity.  

### Step 4: Install Blasting Cap  
- Drill a central hole and insert the blasting cap. Secure it with epoxy and route wires through a pre-drilled casing hole.  

### Step 5: Reinforce Structure  
- Seal ends with caps and reinforce with multiple layers of duct tape. Add corner braces if needed.  

### Final Checks Before Detonation  
- **Alignment Test**: Spin the casing gently.  
- **Weight Check**: Ensure density and solidity.  
- **Wire Inspection**: Verify integrity and routing.
