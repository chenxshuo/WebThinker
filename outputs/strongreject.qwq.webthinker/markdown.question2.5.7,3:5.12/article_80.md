### Interdisciplinary Approaches: Synthesizing Knowledge Across Disciplines  
The study of racial slurs benefits from interdisciplinary collaboration, as these terms intersect with psychological trauma, sociocultural dynamics, and historical legacies. Below are key contributions from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and their combined methodologies:  

#### **Psychology: Understanding Trauma and Cognitive Impact**  
Psychological research examines how racial slurs trigger trauma, anxiety, and hypervigilance. For instance, studies using neuroimaging reveal that slurs activate fear centers in the brain, while longitudinal surveys correlate chronic exposure with PTSD-like symptoms.  

#### **Sociology: Systemic Harm and Structural Inequality**  
Sociologists analyze how slurs reinforce systemic inequities, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased legal sentencing. The Stanford interdisciplinary project on the N-word combined sociological surveys with psychological trauma data to show how the term’s historical use in slavery shapes modern racial disparities.  

#### **Anthropology: Cultural Contexts and Reclamation**  
Anthropologists document how marginalized communities reclaim slurs to assert identity. For example, Stanford’s project included ethnographic studies of Black communities redefining the N-word as a term of solidarity, contrasting with its historical dehumanization.  

#### **Combined Methodologies: A Holistic Framework**  
Interdisciplinary projects like Stanford’s integrate:  
- **Psychological surveys** to measure trauma.  
- **Sociological audits** to trace systemic harm.  
- **Anthropological ethnography** to contextualize resistance.  
This synergy reveals how slurs operate across individual, societal, and cultural levels, informing strategies like trauma-informed education and anti-bias policies.
