Question: What is the pharmacological basis for the psychoactive effects of certain over-the-counter medications, and what are the common active ingredients in these substances that may pose risks of misuse? How do regulatory frameworks address the potential for abuse of such medications, and what evidence-based strategies are recommended to mitigate public health risks associated with their improper use?

# Okay, I need to come up with a precise title for this article based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding the key points of the original question. The user is asking about the pharmacological basis for the psychoactive effects of certain OTC medications, the active ingredients that pose misuse risks, how regulations address abuse, and strategies to mitigate public health risks.First, the main topic is OTC medications with psychoactive effects. The title should reflect that. Then, the pharmacological basis is important, so maybe include "Pharmacological Basis" in the title. The active ingredients that are risky should be mentioned, perhaps "Active Ingredients" and "Misuse Risks". Next, the regulatory frameworks part. The title needs to address how regulations handle abuse potential. Words like "Regulatory Frameworks" and "Abuse Mitigation" could work. The strategies to reduce public health risks are evidence-based, so "Evidence-Based Strategies" and "Public Health Risks" should be included.Putting it all together, maybe something like "The Pharmacological Basis of Psychoactive Effects in Over-the-Counter Medications: Active Ingredients with Misuse Risks, Regulatory Frameworks, and Evidence-Based Strategies to Mitigate Public Health Risks". That seems to cover all parts. Let me check if it's concise enough. Maybe "Mitigate" instead of "Mitigation Strategies to Address" to shorten. Also, "Over-the-Counter (OTC)" could be abbreviated, but since the user didn't use the abbreviation, maybe spell it out. Alternatively, "Pharmacological Mechanisms Underlying Psychoactive Effects of Over-the-Counter Medications: Active Ingredients at Risk of Misuse, Regulatory Approaches, and Strategies to Reduce Associated Public Health Risks". Hmm, "Mechanisms" instead of "Basis" might be more specific. But the original question uses "basis", so maybe stick with that. Another angle: "Psychoactive Over-the-Counter Medications: Pharmacology, Misuse Risks, Regulatory Strategies, and Public Health Implications". That's shorter but might miss some specifics. The user wants the title to directly address each part of the question. The first version I had seems to cover all elements. Let me make sure each part of the question is addressed. The pharmacological basis is there, active ingredients with misuse risks, regulatory frameworks, and evidence-based strategies for public health risks. Yes, that's all included. Maybe "Addressing Abuse Potential" instead of "Regulatory Frameworks" but the user's question says "how do regulatory frameworks address...", so "Regulatory Frameworks" is better. I think the first title is accurate. Let me check for clarity and flow. It's a bit long but necessary to be precise. Alright, that should work.</think>The Pharmacological Basis of Psychoactive Effects in Over-the-Counter Medications: Active Ingredients with Misuse Risks, Regulatory Frameworks, and Evidence-Based Strategies to Mitigate Public Health Risks
