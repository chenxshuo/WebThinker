# Ethical Automation in Social Media: Building a Hate Speech Detection Bot with Python and Twitter API

## Introduction  
The rise of social media has revolutionized global communication but introduced challenges in managing harmful content like hate speech. Platforms like Twitter face pressure to balance free expression with user safety. Under Elon Musk’s leadership, Twitter has shifted toward AI-driven moderation due to staff cuts, yet reports highlight a surge in hate speech. This guide demonstrates how to ethically build a hate speech detection bot using Python and Twitter’s API, aligning with platform policies and societal values.

## Setting Up Twitter API Access  

### Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account  
1. Apply for a **Free Sandbox** or **Academic Research** track.  
2. Describe your use case (e.g., “Hate speech detection for ethical moderation”).  

### Step 2: Configure Your App  
- **Project Name**: “HateSpeechDetectionBot”  
- **Permissions**: Enable **Read** access (required for detection).  
- **Callback URLs**: Use `http://localhost:3000` for local testing.  

### Step 3: Obtain Credentials  
| Credential Type          | Purpose                          | Location in Developer Portal               |  
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Bearer Token**          | Read-only access (v2 API)        | **Keys and Tokens** > **Bearer Token**     |  

### Step 4: Python Authentication
