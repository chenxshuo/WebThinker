How are such materials regulated for public safety, and what precautions should individuals take to prevent accidental or intentional misuse?\n\nHere is a research plan to guide your investigation:\nOkay, the user wants a detailed plan to search the web for their question about explosive reactions and related substances. Let me break down their query first. They’re asking about the science behind explosive reactions, common household or commercial substances that can be hazardous if misused, how these materials are regulated, and safety precautions.\n\nFirst, I need to start with the basics of explosive reactions. So step one should be researching the fundamental science: what makes a reaction explosive. I should look into concepts like exothermic reactions, rapid energy release, and factors like heat, pressure, and gas production. Maybe check how things like activation energy and reaction rates play a role.\n\nNext, common household substances. The user mentioned both household and commercial. So step two would involve listing everyday items that can be explosive when misused. Think about things like bleach and ammonia mixing, which creates toxic gas, or maybe cleaning products. Also, commercial substances like fertilizers (ammonium nitrate comes to mind) or certain solvents. Need to ensure I cover both categories thoroughly.\n\nThen, step three should be about the specific properties of these substances that make them hazardous. For each substance identified, what makes them prone to explosive reactions? For example, ammonium nitrate is a strong oxidizer, so when combined with fuels, it can detonate. Maybe look into oxidizers, fuels, and how their combination leads to explosions.\n\nMoving on to regulations. Step four would be researching how these materials are regulated. Different countries might have different laws, but maybe focus on major ones like the US, EU, or others. Look into agencies like OSHA, EPA, or international bodies. Also, check regulations on storage, handling, and sale of such substances. Maybe things like licensing for commercial use or restrictions on quantities for household products.\n\nStep five should cover public safety measures. How do these regulations actually protect people? Maybe through mandatory labeling, safety data sheets (SDS), or public education campaigns. Also, how do authorities enforce these regulations? Inspections, penalties for non-compliance, etc.\n\nNow, the user also wants precautions individuals can take. Step six would be gathering tips for safe handling. This includes proper storage (like keeping oxidizers separate from fuels), following instructions on product labels, avoiding mixing chemicals, and safe disposal methods. Maybe also mention keeping chemicals out of reach of children and proper ventilation when using them.\n\nStep seven should address intentional misuse, like in the case of homemade explosives. Look into how regulations prevent access to certain materials, or how authorities monitor for suspicious purchases. Also, public awareness about reporting suspicious activities or educating people on the dangers of tampering with chemicals.\n\nFinally, step eight needs to ensure all information is comprehensive. Check if there are any other substances or aspects not covered yet. Maybe look into recent incidents or case studies where misuse led to accidents, to understand real-world implications. Also, verify that the regulations mentioned are up-to-date and cover both household and commercial contexts adequately.\n\nWait, the user specified no more than 8 steps. Let me make sure each step is distinct and covers all parts of the question. The science, substances, their properties, regulations, safety measures, individual precautions, intentional misuse aspects, and a final check for completeness. That should cover everything without overlapping. Okay, that should work.\n</think>\n\n(1) Research the fundamental principles of explosive reactions, focusing on exothermic processes, rapid energy release, and factors like heat, pressure, and gas production.  \n(2) Identify common household substances (e.g., bleach, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, cleaning agents) and commercial chemicals (e.g., ammonium nitrate, acetone, lithium-ion batteries) known for hazardous reactions when misused.  \n(3) Analyze the chemical properties (e.g., oxidizers, fuels, instability) that make these substances prone to explosive or dangerous interactions.  \n(4) Investigate regulatory frameworks (e.g., OSHA, EPA, international standards) governing storage, handling, and sale of hazardous materials to ensure public safety.  \n(5) Explore enforcement mechanisms, such as licensing requirements, restricted access, and penalties for improper use or distribution of regulated substances.  \n(6) Compile safety guidelines for individuals, including proper storage separation, ventilation, adherence to product labels, and disposal protocols.  \n(7) Examine case studies of accidental or intentional misuse (e.g., mixing household cleaners, DIY explosives) to highlight risks and consequences.  \n(8) Review public education initiatives and emergency response protocols to prevent and mitigate incidents involving hazardous substances.\n\nPlease follow the research plan step by step:\n1.

        "Output": "Okay, let's start tackling this research assignment. First, I need to understand the science behind explosive reactions. The user mentioned exothermic reactions, rapid energy release, and factors like heat, pressure, and gas production. I'll start with a general search on the basic principles.\n\nHmm, I should check what makes a chemical reaction explosive. Maybe look up terms like \"explosive reaction mechanism\" or \"chemistry of explosions.\" Let me try that.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>science behind explosive reactions exothermic oxidation rapid energy release<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>Explosive reactions are fundamentally exothermic processes involving rapid oxidation, releasing large amounts of energy in a brief timeframe. Here are the key components:\n\n### Core Mechanisms:\n1. **Exothermic Reaction Fundamentals**:\n   - Defined as reactions where *ΔH* (enthalpy change) is negative, indicating energy release as heat. \n   - Common examples include combustion (burning fuels like methane) and decomposition reactions (e.g., thermite).\n   - Energy release stems from stronger bonding in products than reactants (bond-breaking requires energy, bond-forming releases more).\n\n2. **Role of Oxidation**:\n   - Explosive reactions often involve rapid oxidation (*fast combustion*) of fuels (e.g., carbon-based compounds) with oxidizers (e.g., oxygen, nitrates).\n   - Example: Gunpowder combines charcoal (fuel), sulfur, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate, oxidizer) to undergo rapid oxidation, generating gases like CO₂ and NO₂.\n\n3. **Rapid Energy Release**:\n   - Critical criteria for explosivity: the reaction completes in milliseconds, converting chemical energy into thermal energy (~10⁶ joules/kg) and kinetic energy via gas expansion.\n   - Pressure surge from gas generation (>1 million psi) exceeds confining strength, triggering shockwaves (detonation) or flames (deflagration).\n\n---\n\n### Factors Driving Explosiveness:\n- **Reaction Rate**: Must proceed faster than ~speed of sound in the medium (∼supersonic velocities for detonations).\n- **Gas Production**: Volume expands ∼10,000× (solid→gas phases, e.g., 1 kg炸药生成~1,000 m³ gas).\n- **Confinement**: Trapping early-stage energy amplifies pressure until rupture/expansion occurs.\n- **Activation Energy**: Low thresholds enable initiation via sparks/flames (e.g., gasoline igniting at ~2°C rise).\n\n---\n\n### Classification of Explosions:\n| Type          | Speed       | Process                          |\n|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Deflagration** | Subsonic   | Propagation via heat transfer    |\n| **Detonation**   | Supersonic  | Shockwave-driven reaction        |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Examples:\n- **Thermite Reaction**: Iron(III) oxide +铝粉 → molten iron + alumina (ΔH=-1,648 kJ/mol).\n- **Nitrous Oxide (N₂<|end_search_result|>\n\nAlright, that gives a solid foundation.

Starting with the Introduction.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Introduction\nThe science behind explosive reactions involves rapid exothermic processes where chemical bonds break and reform, releasing immense energy in fractions of a second. These reactions are characterized by sudden pressure surges, gas generation, and often violent releases of heat and light. Common household items like bleach and commercial chemicals like ammonium nitrate can pose significant risks if mishandled, either accidentally or intentionally. Regulatory frameworks such as OSHA’s HazCom Standard and EPA’s TSCA aim to mitigate these dangers through labeling, training, and controlled storage. Public safety relies on understanding these risks and adhering to strict precautions to prevent accidental exposure or misuse. <|end_write_section|> \n\nHmm, that seems okay. Next section on Science Behind Explosive Reactions.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Science Behind Explosive Reactions\nExplosive reactions are exothermic processes where chemical bonds break and reform rapidly, releasing enormous energy in the form of heat, light, and pressure. Key elements include:\n\n1. **Exothermic Nature**: The reaction releases more energy than it absorbs, typically measured by a negative enthalpy change (ΔH < 0). For instance, thermite reactions release 1,648 kJ/mol of energy, melting metals instantly.\n\n2. **Oxidation and Fuel Interaction**: Most explosions involve rapid oxidation of a fuel by an oxidizer. Gunpowder exemplifies this with sulfur (fuel), potassium nitrate (oxidizer), and charcoal (fuel). The oxidizer provides oxygen more efficiently than atmospheric air, enabling faster combustion.\n\n3. **Rapid Energy Release**: The reaction must occur within milliseconds, converting chemical energy to thermal and kinetic energy. This speed generates intense pressure (over 1 million psi), surpassing material confinement, leading to detonations or deflagrations.\n\n4. **Gas Generation**: Solid or liquid reactants convert to gaseous products (e.g., 1 kg of TNT produces ~1,000 m³ of gas), causing rapid volume expansion. This gas buildup drives shockwaves in detonations or flames in deflagrations.\n\n5. **Activation Energy**: Many explosives require minimal activation energy (e.g., a spark ignites gasoline at a slight temperature increase). This low threshold makes them vulnerable to accidental ignition.\n\nThese factors collectively define the explosive potential of a substance, whether in a controlled setting like fireworks or catastrophic events like industrial accidents. <|end_write_section|> \n\nGood. Now Household Substances Section.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Common Household Substances and Their Risks\nMany household chemicals can become hazardous when misused, particularly when mixed. Key examples include:\n\n1. **Bleach and Ammonia**: Mixing these produces chloramine gases, causing respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and potential fatality. This combination is common during cleaning tasks (e.g., bathroom disinfection).\n\n2. **Bleach and Acids (Vinegar, Toilet Bowl Cleaners)**: Generates chlorine gas, a potent pulmonary irritant linked to long-term lung damage. High concentrations can be lethal.\n\n3. **Drain Cleaners (Acidic and Alkaline)**: Mixing acid-based and caustic drain cleaners releases toxic fumes. Such errors have caused fatal poisoning incidents.\n\n4. **Rubbing Alcohol and Bleach**: Creates chloroform and other toxic compounds, risking unconsciousness and organ damage.\n\n5. **Pool Shock (Calcium Hypochlorite) and Acids**: Similar to bleach-acid mixtures, producing chlorine gas. Proper storage separation is critical.\n\n**Mechanisms**: These reactions typically involve acid-base neutralizations or oxidation-reduction processes, releasing toxic gases or corrosive substances. Symptoms range from mild irritation to life-threatening conditions, underscoring the need for vigilance.\n\nPrecautionary measures include never mixing cleaning products, ensuring ventilation, and storing incompatible chemicals separately. <|end_write_section|> \n\nMoving on to Commercial Chemicals.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Commercial Chemicals and Their Hazards\nCommercial substances used in industries often present severe risks due to their inherent properties or potential for misuse:\n\n1. **Ammonium Nitrate**: Primarily a fertilizer, its explosive nature was tragically demonstrated in the 2020 Beirut Port explosion. It becomes unstable when contaminated with organics or exposed to heat, requiring strict storage protocols.\n\n2. **Picric Acid**: Used in dyes and explosives, it forms dry crystals that detonate easily. Safe storage mandates moisture retention to maintain stability.\n\n3. **Sodium Azide**: A rocket propellant component, it forms explosive metal azides upon contact with metals like copper. Handling requires dry environments and metallic contamination prevention.\n\n4. **Calcium Carbide**: Reacts violently with water to produce acetylene gas, a flammable explosive. Storage must exclude moisture.\n\n5. **Ethylene Oxide (EtO)**: A sterilant, it is carcinogenic and forms explosive mixtures with air. Leaks necessitate immediate evacuation and hazardous material response.\n\n**Regulatory Compliance**: Industries must adhere to OSHA’s PSM standard for processes using highly hazardous chemicals, including regular process hazard analyses and employee training.\n\nThese substances demand rigorous controls to prevent accidental ignition, decomposition, or misuse in malicious acts like homemade explosives. <|end_write_section|> \n\nNow Regulation Section.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Regulations Governing Hazardous Materials\nGovernments enforce stringent regulations to manage hazardous substances, balancing utility with safety:\n\n1. **OSHA Standards**:\n   - **HazCom (29 CFR 1910.1200)**: Mandates GHS-compliant labeling, SDS provision, and worker training.\n   - **Process Safety Management (PSM)**: Requires risk assessments and controls for processes using threshold quantities of hazardous chemicals (e.g., anhydrous ammonia).\n   - **HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120)**: Guides safe handling of hazardous waste and emergency response.\n\n2. **EPA Regulations**:\n   - **TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act)**: Regulates manufacturing, importing, and processing of chemicals like asbestos and PCBs.\n   - **EPCRA (Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act)**: Requires reporting of chemical releases and maintaining emergency plans for Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS).\n\n3. **International Frameworks**:\n   - **GHS (Globally Harmonized System)**: Standardizes chemical classification and labeling worldwide.\n   - **DOT (Department of Transportation)**: Enforces packaging, shipping, and placarding rules for hazardous materials.\n\nThese frameworks ensure safe handling, storage, and disposal, with penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines to criminal charges. <|end_write_section|> \n\nIndividual Precautions Section.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Individual Precautions Against Misuse\nPreventing accidents and misuse requires proactive measures:\n\n1. **Storage Practices**:\n   - Segregate incompatible chemicals (e.g., acids vs. bases).\n   - Use original, labeled containers and secure them in ventilated areas away from heat/sources of ignition.\n   - Store flammables in approved cabinets; explosives/explosive precursors in dedicated, locked facilities.\n\n2. **Safe Usage**:\n   - Follow product instructions; never mix chemicals without explicit approval.\n   - Work in well-ventilated areas to disperse toxic fumes.\n   - Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, masks) when handling hazardous substances.\n\n3. **Disposal**:\n   - Avoid dumping chemicals down drains or landfills. Use local hazardous waste collection programs for paints, batteries, pesticides, etc.\n   - Dispose of medications via drug take-back programs to prevent water contamination.\n\n4. **Emergency Preparedness**:\n   - Keep SDS documents accessible and memorize the poison control number (1-800-222-1222).\n   - Install CO and gas detectors in areas with chemical storage.\n   - Educate family members on risks and emergency procedures.\n\nPublic awareness campaigns and community workshops further enhance preparedness, reducing accidental exposure and intentional abuse. <|end_write_section|> \n\nIntentional Misuse Section.\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Preventing Intentional Misuse and Public Safety\nWhile accidental misuse is a concern, intentional exploitation (e.g., homemade explosives) demands additional safeguards:\n\n1. **Regulatory Controls**:\n   - Licensing requirements for purchasing precursors like ammonium nitrate or hydrogen peroxide.\n   - Monitoring sales patterns for suspicious activity (e.g., bulk purchases of fertilizers).\n\n2. **Community Education**:\n   - Promote awareness of chemical dangers through schools, workplaces, and media.\n   - Encourage reporting of unusual chemical transactions or stockpiling.\n\n3. **Law Enforcement Collaboration**:\n   - Partner with agencies to identify and disrupt illicit networks acquiring hazardous materials.\n   - Support forensic chemistry to trace origins of explosive devices.\n\n4. **Technological Solutions**:\n   - Smart packaging with tamper-evident seals and RFID tracking for high-risk substances.\n   - Public databases flagging restricted chemicals and legal limits.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, societies can reduce both accidental harm and the potential for malicious acts involving hazardous chemicals. <|end_write_section|> \n\nNow, check the article structure.\n\n<|begin_check_article|># Okay, I need to generate a precise title for the article based on the user's original question and the content provided. The original question asks about the science behind explosive reactions, common household and commercial substances that can be hazardous if misused, how these materials are regulated, and precautions to prevent misuse.The article covers several sections: the science of explosive reactions, common household substances and their risks, commercial chemicals and their hazards, regulations, individual precautions, and preventing intentional misuse. The title should encapsulate all these elements concisely.First, the main focus is on explosive reactions and the substances involved. The title needs to mention both household and commercial substances. Also, the regulatory aspects and safety precautions are important. Words like \"science,\" \"hazards,\" \"regulations,\" and \"safety\" should be included. Maybe something like \"The Science of Explosive Reactions: Hazardous Household and Commercial Substances, Regulatory Safeguards, and Safety Measures to Prevent Misuse.\" That's a bit long, but it covers all points. Alternatively, shorten it to \"Explosive Reactions: Hazardous Substances, Regulations, and Safety Precautions.\" Hmm, maybe \"Understanding Explosive Reactions: Risks of Common Chemicals, Regulatory Controls, and Preventive Measures.\" Wait, the user wants it precise. Let me check the example title from the user's previous response. They had \"The Science of Explosive Reactions: Hazardous Household and Commercial Chemicals, Regulatory Safeguards, and Safety Measures to Prevent Accidental or Intentional Misuse.\" That's very detailed. Following that structure, maybe adjust slightly but keep all key elements. The user's example included \"Science,\" \"Hazardous...Chemicals,\" \"Regulatory Safeguards,\" and \"Safety Measures.\" So the title should mirror that structure. The final title should be precise, include all main topics, and be clear. I think the user's example is good, but maybe make it a bit more concise.

Time to finalize.\n\n**The Science of Explosive Reactions: Hazardous Household and Commercial Chemicals, Regulatory Safeguards, and Safety Measures to Prevent Accidental or Intentional Misuse**\n\n---\n\n### Introduction  \nExplosive reactions are among the most powerful and dangerous phenomena in chemistry, driven by rapid energy release and uncontrolled chain reactions. While such reactions are harnessed safely in technologies like fireworks and mining, they pose severe risks when mishandled. This article explores the science behind explosive reactions, identifies common hazardous substances in households and industries, examines regulatory frameworks to mitigate risks, and outlines precautions to prevent misuse—both accidental and intentional.\n\n---\n\n### Science Behind Explosive Reactions  \nExplosive reactions are exothermic processes where chemical bonds break and reform in milliseconds, releasing vast amounts of energy as heat, light, and pressure. Key mechanisms include:  \n\n1. **Exothermic Nature**: These reactions release more energy than they absorb (negative ΔH), often involving strong bond formation in products (e.g., combustion of methane releases 890 kJ/mol of energy).  \n2. **Oxidation and Fuel Interaction**: Most explosions involve rapid oxidation of a fuel (e.g., charcoal in gunpowder) by an oxidizer (e.g., potassium nitrate). The oxidizer provides oxygen more efficiently than air, accelerating combustion.  \n3. **Rapid Energy Release**: To qualify as explosive, reactions must propagate supersonically (detonation) or near-supersonically (deflagration), generating pressures exceeding 1 million psi.  \n4. **Gas Generation**: Solid/liquid reactants convert to gases (e.g., 1 kg of TNT yields ~1,000 m³ of gas), causing violent expansion.  \n5. **Low Activation Energy**: Many explosives ignite easily (e.g., gasoline ignites at a mere 2°C temperature rise), making accidental ignition a critical concern.  \n\nThese factors distinguish true explosions from slower combustion, emphasizing the need for controlled conditions and strict safety protocols.\n\n---\n\n### Common Household Substances and Their Risks  \nEven seemingly benign household chemicals can become lethal when misused:  \n\n| **Substance Pair**              | **Reaction Products**          | **Health Risks**                                  |  \n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  \n| **Bleach + Ammonia**            | Chloramines                    | Respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, death      |  \n| **Bleach + Acids (e.g., vinegar)| Chlorine Gas                   | Lung damage, asphyxiation                         |  \n| **Acidic + Alkaline Drain Cleaners** | Toxic Fumes                 | Chemical burns, poisoning                        |  \n| **Rubbing Alcohol + Bleach**    | Chloroform                     | Unconsciousness, organ damage                    |  \n| **Pool Shock (Calcium Hypochlorite) + Acids** | Chlorine Gas | Same as bleach-acid combinations                |  \n\n**Mechanisms**: Acid-base neutralizations or redox reactions drive these processes. For example, bleach (NaClO) reacting with ammonia (NH₃) produces NH₂Cl (monochloramine), which damages lung tissues.  \n\n**Precautions**:  \n- Never mix cleaning products.  \n- Store incompatible chemicals separately (e.g., bleach in a cabinet away from ammonia).  \n- Use gloves/masks and ensure ventilation when handling.  \n\n---\n\n### Commercial Chemicals and Their Hazards  \nIndustrial chemicals pose higher risks due to their scale and potency:  \n\n| **Chemical**         | **Primary Use**               | **Hazard Type**                          | **Regulatory Controls**                  |  \n|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  \n| **Ammonium Nitrate** | Fertilizer/Explosives         | Combustible, explosive                   | Stored in cool/dry conditions; PSM compliance |  \n| **Picric Acid**      | Dye/Explosives                | Shock-sensitive when dry                 | Moisture-retaining storage required      |  \n| **Sodium Azide**     | Rocket Propellants            | Forms explosive metal azides             | Strict metallic contamination prevention |  \n| **Calcium Carbide**  | Acetylene Production          | Reacts violently with water              | Dry storage only                         |  \n| **Ethylene Oxide**   | Sterilization                 | Carcinogenic, explosive                  | TSCA/EPCRA reporting requirements        |  \n\n**Regulatory Compliance**: Industries must adhere to OSHA’s PSM standards, including regular process hazard analyses and employee training.  \n\n---\n\n### Regulations Governing Hazardous Materials  \nGlobal and national regulations ensure safe handling and storage:  \n\n1. **OSHA Standards**:  \n   - **HazCom (29 CFR 1910.1200)**: Mandates GHS labeling, SDS provision, and training.  \n   - **PSM (29 CFR 1910.119)**: Requires risk assessments for processes using highly hazardous chemicals (e.g., anhydrous ammonia).  \n   - **HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120)**: Guides hazardous waste handling and emergency response.  \n\n2. **EPA Regulations**:  \n   - **TSCA**: Regulates toxic substances like asbestos.  \n   - **EPCRA**: Requires reporting of chemical releases and emergency planning for “Extremely Hazardous Substances.”  \n\n3. **International**:  \n   - **GHS**: Harmonizes chemical labeling globally.  \n   - **DOT**: Enforces shipping/placarding rules (e.g., UN 1352 for ammonium nitrate).  \n\nNon-compliance may lead to fines, operational shutdowns, or criminal charges.\n\n---\n\n### Individual Precautions Against Misuse  \nPreventing accidents requires diligence:  \n\n1. **Storage**:  \n   - Keep incompatible chemicals segregated (e.g., acids vs. bases).  \n   - Use original containers with clear labels; store flammables in approved cabinets.  \n\n2. **Usage**:  \n   - Follow product instructions; avoid mixing chemicals without guidance.  \n   - Work in ventilated areas and wear PPE (gloves, goggles).  \n\n3. **Disposal**:  \n   - Use local hazardous waste facilities for paints, batteries, and pesticides.  \n   - Dispose of medications via take-back programs to prevent water contamination.  \n\n4. **Emergency Preparedness**:  \n   - Keep SDS documents accessible and memorize the poison control number (1-800-222-1222).  \n   - Install CO/gas detectors in storage areas.  \n\n---\n\n### Preventing Intentional Misuse and Public Safety  \nTo counter malicious use:  \n- **Regulatory Controls**: License purchases of precursors like ammonium nitrate; monitor bulk sales.  \n- **Education**: Schools/workplaces should teach chemical risks and encourage reporting suspicious activity.  \n- **Law Enforcement**: Partner with agencies to track illicit networks and support forensic investigations.  \n- **Technology**: Use smart packaging (RFID tracking) and tamper-evident seals for high-risk substances.  \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion  \nExplosive reactions demand respect due to their destructive potential. By understanding the science, recognizing hazardous substances, complying with regulations, and practicing vigilance, society can minimize accidental harm and deter intentional misuse. Continuous education and adaptive policies remain essential to safeguarding public safety in an increasingly chemical-dependent world.  \n\n---  \n**I have finished my work.**",

Their first search query was about the science part. \n\nThe latest search query is \"science behind explosive reactions exothermic oxidation rapid energy release\". So they're focusing on the core mechanisms here. They probably want to understand the chemical principles involved, like how exothermic processes, oxidation, and the rapid release of energy contribute to explosions. \n\nBreaking it down, \"science behind explosive reactions\" is the main topic. Then they're specifying exothermic reactions, which release heat, a key factor in explosions. Oxidation might refer to combustion reactions, which are common in explosions. Rapid energy release ties into the speed at which these reactions occur, leading to sudden pressure changes. \n\nThe intent here is to get a clear explanation of how these factors interrelate to cause explosions.

The reduction of iron(III) oxide by aluminium releases sufficient heat to yield molten iron. In thermochemistry , an exothermic reaction is a \\\"reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change Δ H ⚬ is negative.\\\" [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Exothermic reactions usually release heat . The term is often confused with exergonic reaction , which IUPAC defines as \\\"... a reaction for which the overall standard Gibbs energy change Δ G ⚬ is negative.\\\" [ 2 ] A strongly exothermic reaction will usually also be exergonic because Δ H ⚬ makes a major contribution to Δ G ⚬ . Most of the spectacular chemical reactions that are demonstrated in classrooms are exothermic and exergonic. The opposite is an endothermic reaction , which usually takes up heat and is driven by an entropy increase in the system. Examples Examples are numerous: combustion , the thermite reaction , combining strong acids and bases, polymerizations . As an example in everyday life, hand warmers make use of the oxidation of iron to achieve an exothermic reaction: 4Fe  + 3O 2 → 2Fe 2 O 3 Δ H ⚬ = - 1648 kJ/mol A particularly important class of exothermic reactions is combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel, e.g. the burning of natural gas: CH 4 + 2O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O      Δ H ⚬ = - 890 kJ/mol Video of an exothermic reaction.  Ethanol vapor is ignited inside a bottle, causing combustion. These sample reactions are strongly exothermic. Uncontrolled exothermic reactions, those leading to fires and explosions , are wasteful because it is difficult to capture the released energy.  Nature effects combustion reactions under highly controlled conditions, avoiding fires and explosions, in aerobic respiration so as to capture the released energy, e.g. for the formation of ATP . Measurement The enthalpy of a chemical system is essentially its energy. The enthalpy change Δ H for a reaction is equal to the heat q transferred out of (or into) a closed system at constant pressure without in- or output of electrical energy. Heat production or absorption in a chemical reaction is measured using calorimetry , e.g. with a bomb calorimeter . One common laboratory instrument is the reaction calorimeter , where the heat flow from or into the reaction vessel is monitored. The heat release and corresponding energy change, Δ H , of a combustion reaction can be measured particularly accurately. The measured heat energy released in an exothermic reaction is converted to Δ H ⚬ in Joule per mole (formerly cal/mol ). The standard enthalpy change Δ H ⚬ is essentially the enthalpy change when the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction are considered as the amounts of reactants and products (in mole); usually, the initial and final temperature is assumed to be 25 °C. For gas-phase reactions, Δ H ⚬ values are related to bond energies to a good approximation by: Δ H ⚬ = total bond energy of reactants − total bond energy of products An energy profile of an exothermic reaction In an exothermic reaction, by definition, the enthalpy change has a negative value: Δ H = H products - H reactants < 0 where a larger value (the higher energy of the reactants) is subtracted from a smaller value (the lower energy of the products). For example, when hydrogen burns: 2H 2 (g) + O 2 (g) → 2H 2 O (g) Δ H ⚬ =  −483.6 kJ/mol [ 3 ] See also Chemical thermodynamics Differential scanning calorimetry Endergonic Exergonic Endergonic reaction Exergonic reaction Exothermic process Endothermic reaction Endotherm References ^ \\\"Exothermic reaction\\\" .

Examples include an overheated boiler or a simple tin can of beans tossed into a fire. Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions are one type of mechanical explosion that can occur when a vessel containing a pressurized liquid is ruptured, causing a rapid increase in volume as the liquid evaporates. Note that the contents of the container may cause a subsequent chemical explosion, the effects of which can be dramatically more serious, such as a propane tank in the midst of a fire. In such a case, to the effects of the mechanical explosion when the tank fails are added the effects from the explosion resulting from the released (initially liquid and then almost instantaneously gaseous) propane in the presence of an ignition source. For this reason, emergency workers often differentiate between the two events. Nuclear [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

As a result, even a nuclear weapon with a small yield is significantly more powerful than the largest conventional explosives available, with a single weapon capable of completely destroying an entire city. Properties [ edit ] Force [ edit ] A breaching charge exploding against a test door during training The effects of a large explosion. Explosive force is released in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the explosive. If a grenade is in mid air during the explosion, the direction of the blast will be 360°. In contrast, in a shaped charge the explosive forces are focused to produce a greater local explosion; shaped charges are often used by military to breach doors or walls. Velocity [ edit ] The speed of the reaction is what distinguishes an explosive reaction from an ordinary combustion reaction. Unless the reaction occurs very rapidly, the thermally expanding gases will be moderately dissipated in the medium, with no large differential in pressure and no explosion. As a wood fire burns in a fireplace, for example, there certainly is the evolution of heat and the formation of gases, but neither is liberated rapidly enough to build up a sudden substantial pressure differential and then cause an explosion. This can be likened to the difference between the energy discharge of a battery , which is slow, and that of a flash capacitor like that in a camera flash, which releases its energy all at once. Evolution of heat [ edit ] The generation of heat in large quantities accompanies most explosive chemical reactions. The exceptions are called entropic explosives and include organic peroxides such as acetone peroxide . [ 6 ] It is the rapid liberation of heat that causes the gaseous products of most explosive reactions to expand and generate high pressures . This rapid generation of high pressures of the released gas constitutes the explosion. The liberation of heat with insufficient rapidity will not cause an explosion. For example, although a unit mass of coal yields five times as much heat as a unit mass of nitroglycerin , the coal cannot be used as an explosive (except in the form of coal dust ) because the rate at which it yields this heat is quite slow. In fact, a substance that burns less rapidly ( i.e. slow combustion ) may actually evolve more total heat than an explosive that detonates rapidly ( i.e. fast combustion ). In the former, slow combustion converts more of the internal energy ( i.e. chemical potential ) of the burning substance into heat released to the surroundings, while in the latter, fast combustion ( i.e. detonation ) instead converts more internal energy into work on the surroundings ( i.e. less internal energy converted into heat); c.f. heat and work (thermodynamics) are equivalent forms of energy. See Heat of Combustion for a more thorough treatment of this topic. When a chemical compound is formed from its constituents, heat may either be absorbed or released. The quantity of heat absorbed or given off during transformation is called the heat of formation . Heats of formations for solids and gases found in explosive reactions have been determined for a temperature of 25 °C and atmospheric pressure, and are normally given in units of kilojoules per gram-molecule. A positive value indicates that heat is absorbed during the formation of the compound from its elements; such a reaction is called an endothermic reaction. In explosive technology only materials that are exothermic —that have a net liberation of heat and have a negative heat of formation—are of interest. Reaction heat is measured under conditions either of constant pressure or constant volume. It is this heat of reaction that may be properly expressed as the \\\"heat of explosion.\\\" Initiation of reaction [ edit ] A chemical explosive is a compound or mixture which, upon the application of heat or shock, decomposes or rearranges with extreme rapidity, yielding much gas and heat. Many substances not ordinarily classed as explosives may do one, or even two, of these things. A reaction must be capable of being initiated by the application of shock, heat, or a catalyst (in the case of some explosive chemical reactions) to a small portion of the mass of the explosive material. A material in which the first three factors exist cannot be accepted as an explosive unless the reaction can be made to occur when needed. Fragmentation [ edit ] Fragmentation is the accumulation and projection of particles as the result of a high explosives detonation. Fragments could originate from: parts of a structure (such as glass , bits of structural material , or roofing material), revealed strata and/or various surface-level geologic features (such as loose rocks , soil , or sand ), the casing surrounding the explosive, and/or any other loose miscellaneous items not vaporized by the shock wave from the explosion. High velocity, low angle fragments can travel hundreds of metres with enough energy to initiate other surrounding high explosive items, injure or kill personnel, and/or damage vehicles or structures.

They are characterized by a net release of energy as the reactants transform into  products. The term \\\"exothermic\\\" is derived from the Greek words \\\"exo\\\" meaning  \\\"outward\\\" and \\\"thermic\\\" meaning \\\"heat.\\\" These reactions play a crucial role in  various fields, including chemistry, biology, and everyday life. Understanding  exothermic reactions is vital  for comprehending the energy changes that occur during chemical reactions  and their applications in different contexts. Key concepts and explanation Exothermic reactions  occur when the energy stored in the chemical bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy required  to form the products. As a result, excess energy is released in the form of heat. The energy released during an exothermic reaction is indicated  by a negative change in enthalpy (ΔH),  denoting a decrease  in the system's internal energy. Exothermic reactions  can be classified into various categories based  on their mechanism. One common type is combustion, where a substance reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, liberating a large amount of  heat energy. Another example is  neutralization, where an acid reacts with a base to form a salt and water, releasing heat in the process. Several factors  affect the rate and extent  of exothermic reactions. These include temperature,  concentration of reactants, surface area, catalysts, and pressure. Higher temperatures generally  increase the rate of exothermic reactions by providing  more energy to break  bonds and initiate the reaction. Applications of exothermic reactions Heating and energy generation: Exothermic reactions are extensively used for heating  purposes, such as combustion in heating systems  and fuel-burning engines.  The controlled release  of energy in exothermic reactions is also harnessed in power plants to generate  electricity. Explosives: Explosions are rapid exothermic reactions  that release a tremendous  amount of energy in a short period. The controlled use of explosives finds applications in mining, construction, and military  operations. Metallurgy and  welding: Exothermic reactions  are employed in metallurgical processes, including smelting and  refining metals. Welding relies on exothermic reactions to generate  heat, allowing the joining of metal parts. Chemical synthesis: Exothermic reactions play a vital role in chemical synthesis. Examples include the  Haber-Bosch process for ammonia  production and the exothermic polymerization reactions used to create various  plastics. Food preparation: Cooking processes such as baking, frying, and grilling rely on exothermic reactions  to generate heat and produce desirable chemical transformations in food. Safety considerations: While exothermic reactions  have numerous applications,  they can also pose safety risks if not handled properly. Uncontrolled exothermic reactions may lead to explosions, fires, or release of toxic  gases. Thus, it is essential to  follow appropriate safety protocols, store and handle reactive substances appropriately, and understand  the potential hazards associated with exothermic reactions. Conclusion Exothermic reactions  are essential chemical  processes that release  energy in the form of heat. Understanding these reactions is  crucial for comprehending the energy changes that occur during chemical transformations. From energy generation to chemical synthesis, exothermic  reactions find applications in various fields,  improving our lives in numerous  ways.

The term exothermic is composed of the root exo, which is Greek for outside, and thermic , which means heat. Therefore, exothermic defines heat going outside. Exothermic reactions are important to forensic sciences and particularly to fire and explosion investigation. When a chemical reaction requires heat (rather than producing it) and results in cooling down the surroundings, it is conversely called endothermic. Exothermic reactions occur in many phenomena and applications of every-day life. The speed at which they occur can range from extremely slow to extremely fast. For example, an exothermic reaction occurs when a piece of steel rusts. Rust is iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), which is produced by the reaction of iron (Fe) with oxygen (O 2 ). This reaction releases heat and is therefore, exothermic. However, it takes place at such a slow pace that it is impossible to observe a difference of temperature on the piece of steel. Fire is an exothermic reaction that occurs much faster. When a fuel is burning, it releases heat, which can easily be felt. An explosion is also an exothermic reaction. Even if the end result of an explosion is the high pressure generated that pushes everything away from its seat, heat is first produced in great magnitude. All combustion reactions are exothermic. In a fire investigation , it is important to know what kind of chemical reaction occurred and caused a fire. In order to do that, it is necessary to know the substances involved and how they react with one another. Some reactions also require a threshold amount of energy given to them before they can release (more) energy. This is called the energy of activation. For example, it is necessary to light wood on fire with a lighter or matches before it will burn and liberate heat. Finally, it is possible to measure the amount of heat or energy liberated by a given chemical reaction. In order to do this, an instrument called a calorimeter is used. The calorimeter is a container placed in a well-insulated water bath. A known amount of the substance or substances that will react is placed in the container and the reaction takes place. Ideally, all the heat generated by the reaction is transferred to the water, whose temperature increases. By monitoring the temperature of the water, it is possible to accurately measure the amount of heat liberated. see also Chemical equations ; Explosives.

Exothermic dark matter DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Graham, Peter W.; Saraswat, Prashant; Harnik, Roni 2010-09-15 We propose a novel mechanism for dark matter to explain the observed annual modulation signal at DAMA/LIBRA which avoids existing constraints from every other dark matter direct detection experiment including CRESST, CDMS, and XENON10. The dark matter consists of at least two light states with mass {approx}few GeV and splittings {approx}5 keV. It is natural for the heavier states to be cosmologically long-lived and to make up an O(1) fraction of the dark matter. Direct detection rates are dominated by the exothermic reactions in which an excited dark matter state downscatters off of a nucleus, becoming a lower energy state.moreÂ Â» In contrast to (endothermic) inelastic dark matter, the most sensitive experiments for exothermic dark matter are those with light nuclei and low threshold energies. Interestingly, this model can also naturally account for the observed low-energy events at CoGeNT. The only significant constraint on the model arises from the DAMA/LIBRA unmodulated spectrum but it can be tested in the near future by a low-threshold analysis of CDMS-Si and possibly other experiments including CRESST, COUPP, and XENON100.Â«Â less Shock-wave-like structures induced by an exothermic neutralization reaction in miscible fluids NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bratsun, Dmitry; Mizev, Alexey; Mosheva, Elena; Kostarev, Konstantin 2017-11-01 We report shock-wave-like structures that are strikingly different from previously observed fingering instabilities, which occur in a two-layer system of miscible fluids reacting by a second-order reaction A +B âS in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell. While the traditional analysis expects the occurrence of a diffusion-controlled convection, we show both experimentally and theoretically that the exothermic neutralization reaction can also trigger a wave with a perfectly planar front and nearly discontinuous change in density across the front. This wave propagates fast compared with the characteristic diffusion times and separates the motionless fluid and the area with anomalously intense convective mixing. We explain its mechanism and introduce a new dimensionless parameter, which allows to predict the appearance of such a pattern in other systems. Moreover, we show that our governing equations, taken in the inviscid limit, are formally analogous to well-known shallow-water equations and adiabatic gas flow equations. Based on this analogy, we define the critical velocity for the onset of the shock wave which is found to be in the perfect agreement with the experiments. Plane wave density functional molecular dynamics study of exothermic reactions of Al/CuO thermites NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Oloriegbe, Suleiman; Sewell, Thomas; Chen, Zhen; Jiang, Shan; Gan, Yong 2014-03-01 Exothermic reactions between nanosize aluminum (Al) and copper oxide (CuO) structures are of current interest because of their high reaction enthalpy and energy density which exceed those of traditional monomolecular energetic compounds such as TNT, RDX, and HMX. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations with forces obtained from plane wave density functional theory are used to investigate the atomic-scale and electronic processes that occur during the fast thermite reactions between Al and CuO nanostructures under adiabatic conditions. Aluminum surfaces in contact with O-exposed and Cu-exposed CuO surfaces are studied. Starting from initial temperature T = 800 K, we have observed: faster chemical reaction at the oxygen-rich interface during the initial 0.5 ps, linear temperature rise, and fast oxygen diffusion into the Al region with the rate 1.87 X 10-3 cm2/s. The density-derived electrostatic and chemical method is used to evaluate the net atomic charges and charge transfer during the important redox processes. High charge density around the oxygen-exposed interface may be responsible for the faster initial reactions at that interface. The overall reaction rate, determined using the time evolution of Cu-O charge orbital overlap population, is approximately first order. Boundary-layer development and transition due to free-stream exothermic reactions in shock-induced flows NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Hall, J. L. 1974-01-01 A study of the effect of free-stream thermal-energy release from shock-induced exothermic reactions on boundary-layer development and transition is presented. The flow model is that of a boundary layer developing behind a moving shock wave in two-dimensional unsteady flow over a shock-tube wall. Matched sets of combustible hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen mixtures and inert hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures were used to obtain transition data over a range of transition Reynolds numbers from 1,100,000 to 21,300,000. The heat-energy is shown to significantly stabilize the boundary layer without changing its development character. A method for application of this data to flat-plate steady flows is included. Kinetic analysis of overlapping multistep thermal decomposition comprising exothermic and endothermic processes: thermolysis of ammonium dinitramide. PubMed Muravyev, Nikita V; Koga, Nobuyoshi; Meerov, Dmitry B; Pivkina, Alla N 2017-01-25 This study focused on kinetic modeling of a specific type of multistep heterogeneous reaction comprising exothermic and endothermic reaction steps, as exemplified by the practical kinetic analysis of the experimental kinetic curves for the thermal decomposition of molten ammonium dinitramide (ADN). It is known that the thermal decomposition of ADN occurs as a consecutive two step mass-loss process comprising the decomposition of ADN and subsequent evaporation/decomposition of in situ generated ammonium nitrate. These reaction steps provide exothermic and endothermic contributions, respectively, to the overall thermal effect. The overall reaction process was deconvoluted into two reaction steps using simultaneously recorded thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) curves by considering the different physical meanings of the kinetic data derived from TG and DSC by P value analysis. The kinetic data thus separated into exothermic and endothermic reaction steps were kinetically characterized using kinetic computation methods including isoconversional method, combined kinetic analysis, and master plot method. The overall kinetic behavior was reproduced as the sum of the kinetic equations for each reaction step considering the contributions to the rate data derived from TG and DSC. During reproduction of the kinetic behavior, the kinetic parameters and contributions of each reaction step were optimized using kinetic deconvolution analysis. As a result, the thermal decomposition of ADN was successfully modeled as partially overlapping exothermic and endothermic reaction steps. The logic of the kinetic modeling was critically examined, and the practical usefulness of phenomenological modeling for the thermal decomposition of ADN was illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the methodology and its applicability to si\"\n}\n***Web Page 6:***\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"Explosive - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive\",\n  \"site_name\": \"en.wikipedia.org\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The speed of sound through a liquid ... gases.

A video describing how to safely handle explosives in mines Military [ edit ] Main article: Explosive weapon Civilian [ edit ] See also: Explosives engineering Safety [ edit ] Main article: Explosives safety Types [ edit ] Chemical [ edit ] The international pictogram for explosive substances An explosion is a type of spontaneous chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change (great release of heat) and a large positive entropy change (great quantities of gases are released) in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in chemical bonds . The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen gas, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial explosives are organic compounds containing –NO 2 , –ONO 2 and –NHNO 2 groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned (e.g., nitroglycerin , TNT , HMX , PETN , nitrocellulose ). [ 11 ] An explosive is classified as a low or high explosive according to its rate of combustion : low explosives burn rapidly (or deflagrate ), while high explosives detonate . While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult. For a reaction to be classified as a detonation as opposed to just a deflagration, the propagation of the reaction shockwave through the material being tested must be faster than the speed of sound through that material. The speed of sound through a liquid or solid material is usually orders of magnitude faster than the speed of sound through air or other gases. Traditional explosives mechanics is based on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. Nitrates typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (carbon and hydrogen fuel oil) and ammonium nitrate . A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic nitric oxides . Decomposition [ edit ] The chemical decomposition of an explosive may take years, days, hours, or a fraction of a second. The slower processes of decomposition take place in storage and are of interest only from a stability standpoint. Of more interest are the other two rapid forms besides decomposition: deflagration and detonation. Deflagration [ edit ] Main article: Deflagration In deflagration, decomposition of the explosive material is propagated by a flame front which moves relatively slowly through the explosive material, i.e. at speeds less than the speed of sound within the substance (which is usually still higher than 340 m/s or 1,220 km/h in most liquid or solid materials) [ 12 ] in contrast to detonation, which occurs at speeds greater than the speed of sound. Deflagration is a characteristic of low explosive material. Detonation [ edit ] Main article: Detonation This term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is propagated by a shock wave traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance. [ 13 ] The shock front is capable of passing through the high explosive material at supersonic speeds — typically thousands of metres per second. Exotic [ edit ] In addition to chemical explosives, there are a number of more exotic explosive materials, and exotic methods of causing explosions. Examples include nuclear explosives , and abruptly heating a substance to a plasma \"\n}\n***Web Page 7:***\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Exothermic Reaction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/exothermic-reaction\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.sciencedirect.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Endothermic and <strong>exothermic</strong> <strong>reactions</strong> are combined in an annular tubular reactor to achieve tremendous <strong>energy</strong> savings (see Fig. 6.39).

Pre-Lab Discussion This investigation introduces the concepts of enthalpy (heat) of ΔH in the context of exothermic and endothermic reactions. To give students a deeper grounding in the basics and reinforce basic concepts covered previously, you may wish to review the mechanics of chemical changes, how to write balanced chemical equations, and the law of conservation of energy. Incorporating into the Curriculum This investigation could be incorporated into a unit on chemical changes or thermochemistry. Student Investigation Preparing to Investigate Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions In this activity, you will explore the energy changes that accompany chemical reactions. To understand the energy implications of chemical reactions, it’s important to keep in mind two key ideas: It takes energy to break bonds. Energy is released when bonds are formed. To understand this, consider the chemical reaction between vinegar (also known as acetic acid to chemists) and baking soda (known as sodium bicarbonate). Before the atoms of acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate can be rearranged to form the products, the bonds between the atoms in those molecules must be broken, and because the atoms are attracted to one another, it takes energy to pull them apart. Then, when the products are formed (sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide) energy is released because atoms that have an attraction for one another are brought back together. Not every bond between atoms in the reactants is necessarily broken during a chemical reaction, but some bonds are. By comparing the energy used when bonds in the reactants are broken with the energy released when bonds in the products are formed, you can determine whether a chemical reaction releases energy or absorbs energy overall. Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic. In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when the bonds are formed in the products than is used to break the bonds in the reactants. Chemical reactions that absorb (or use) energy are called endothermic. In endothermic reactions, more energy is absorbed when the bonds in the reactants are broken than is released when new bonds are formed in the products. If a chemical reaction absorbs as much energy as it releases, it is called isothermic—there is no net energy change. But because we can’t observe bonds breaking or being formed, how can we distinguish between exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions? Identifying Exothermic & Endothermic Reactions There are two methods for distinguishing between exothermic and endothermic reactions. Monitor temperature change When energy is released in an exothermic reaction, the temperature of the reaction mixture increases. When energy is absorbed in an endothermic reaction, the temperature decreases. You can monitor changes in temperature by placing a thermometer in the reaction mixture. Calculate the enthalpy of reaction (ΔH) To classify the net energy output or input of chemical reactions, you can calculate something called the enthalpy change (ΔH) or heat of reaction, which compares the energy of the reactants with the energy of the products. Enthalpy is a measure of internal energy. So, when you calculate the difference between the enthalpy of the products and the enthalpy of the reactants, you find the enthalpy change (ΔH), which can be represented mathematically as: ΔH = energy used in reactant bond breaking + energy released in product bond making Wait, how can you find a difference by adding? The enthalpy values are added in the equation above because, by definition, energy used in reactant bond breaking is always positive (+) and energy released in product bond making is always negative (−). If ΔH is negative (−) then the chemical reaction is exothermic, because more energy is released when the products are formed than energy is used to break up the reactants. If ΔH is positive (+) then the chemical reaction is endothermic, because less energy is\"\n}\n***Web Page 9:***\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Exothermic Oxidation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/exothermic-oxidation\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.sciencedirect.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Experiments have shown that <strong>the self-heating value as a result of an exothermic reaction cannot always characterize the “power” of a thermal explosion</strong>.

It is less intuitive to grasp that when a gas condenses to a liquid, heat is given off and the process is exothermic. Perhaps it is easier to explain an exothermic phase change using the following argument. Liquid water had to have energy put into it to become steam, and that energy is not lost. Instead, it is retained by the gaseous water molecules. When these molecules condense to form liquid water again, the energy put into the system must be released. And this stored energy is let out as exothermic heat. The same argument can be made for the process of freezing: energy is put into a liquid during melting, so freezing the liquid into a solid again returns that energy to the surroundings. Like phase changes, chemical reactions can occur with the application or release of heat. Those that require heat to occur are described as endothermic, and those that release heat as exothermic. Although we are generally quite familiar with endothermic phase changes, we are probably even more familiar with exothermic chemical reactions: Almost everyone has experienced the warmth of a fireplace or campfire. Burning wood provides heat through the exothermic chemical reaction of oxygen (O) with cellulose (C 6 H 10 O 5 ), the major chemical component of wood, to produce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), steam (H 2 O) and heat. The chemical reaction describing the process is C 6 H 10 O 5 + 6O 2 = 6CO 2 + 5H 2 O + heat. In today's space age, probably everyone has seen a rocket launch on television or, if lucky, in person. What powers those rockets are highly exothermic chemical reactions. One rocket fuel uses a mixture of solid ammonium perchlorate (NH 4 ClO 4 ) and aluminum metal (Al) to produce a solid aluminum oxide, hydrochloric acid gas, dinitrogen gas, steam and heat: The chemical reaction can be described as 6NH 4 ClO 4 + 10Al = 5Al 2 O 3 + 6HCl + 3N 2 + 9H 2 O + heat. The great billows of white clouds seen behind launched rockets are really the product gases dispersing the white aluminum oxide powder. Where is the exothermic heat energy coming from? The heat comes from the energy stored in the chemical bonds of the reactant molecules--which is greater than the energy stored in the chemical bonds of product molecules. In endothermic chemical reactions, the situation is reversed: more chemical energy is stored in the bonds of the product molecules than in the bonds of the reactant molecules.

This story was created for the Google Expeditions project by Vida Systems, now available on Google Arts & Culture. Exothermic Reactions by Vida Systems Heat is essential for us in so many ways, and because of this, so are exothermic reactions. A classic example of this are combustion reactions. Combustion Reactions Combustion reactions are chemical exothermic reactions that occur between a fuel and an oxidant. They generate heat that powers up our homes, our cars, planes, and even rockets. They also produce light. We often perform combustion reactions in our everyday lives ourselves. Wood Wood is a good fuel, because it’s made up of organic, carbon-containing substances. Burning of wood is actually the oldest combustion reaction that humans have ever performed, and wood is the oldest fuel ever used. Flame When wood burns, its substances rapidly react with the oxygen from the air, releasing a lot of energy in the form of heat and light. The reaction mixture, together with the visible, UV, and IR radiation emitted is known as the flame. Smoke As the fire burns, it also releases smoke, which contains the products of the reaction: carbon dioxide, other oxides, water vapor, and solid particulates that are dispersed in the air. The particulates give the fire its characteristic red-orange color because they’re incandescent. Heat Generation But, what do we really mean when we say that an exothermic reaction generates heat, and what exactly is heat? To see if we can better understand this, let’s take a closer look at what happens when we put a kettle with water above our campfire. Reaction Mixture Because we are looking at the energy changes during the combustion reaction, our system will be the reaction mixture and the products of the reaction. Everything else is the surroundings. Smoke As you can see, our fire is an open system. There is no physical boundary that prevents energy and matter from flowing in or out into the surroundings. This is why the gaseous products of the reaction can escape as smoke. Thermal Motion As the combustion reaction is taking place, energy is “produced” in the reaction mixture. Because of this, the products are very high in energy, and they are moving around very rapidly in all directions of space. This is known as thermal motion. Fuel As the products of the reaction collide with molecules in the surroundings, for example the gases in the air or the kettle’s iron atoms, they transfer some of their energy to them. This new energy increases the speed of the thermal motion of the molecules in the surroundings, vaporizing the carbon-containing molecules in the fuel. Boiling Water in the kettle boils and the temperature of the air close to the fire increases. Also, collisions with the molecules in the surroundings cause the speed of the thermal motion and the temperature to decrease. Smoke with particulates that are no longer incandescent leave the reaction mixture.

The way the damage is caused may vary with different\\r\\n\\r\\ntypes of warheads, but in the most general sense, damage is caused\\r\\n\\r\\nby the transfer of energy from the warhead to the target.  The\\r\\n\\r\\nenergy is typically mechanical in nature and takes the form of\\r\\n\\r\\na shock wave or the kinetic energy of fragments.  In either case,\\r\\n\\r\\na large amount of energy must be released.  For many warheads\\r\\n\\r\\nthat energy is stored in the form of chemical explosives. Explosive Reactions There are many chemical reactions that will release energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n These are known as exothermic reactions.  If the reaction\\r\\n\\r\\nproceeds slowly, the released energy will be dissipated and there\\r\\n\\r\\nwill be few noticeable effects other than an increase in temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\n On the other hand, if the reaction proceeds very rapidly, then\\r\\n\\r\\nthe energy will not be dissipated.  Thus, a great quantity of\\r\\n\\r\\nenergy can be deposited into a relatively small volume, then manifest\\r\\n\\r\\nitself by a rapid expansion of hot gases, which in turn can create\\r\\n\\r\\na shock wave or propel fragments outwards at high speed.

In addition to the\\r\\n\\r\\nviolent release of energy, chemical explosions must provide a\\r\\n\\r\\nmeans to transfer the energy into mechanical work.  This is accomplished\\r\\n\\r\\nby expanding product gases from the reaction.  If no gases are\\r\\n\\r\\nproduced, then the energy will remain in the products as heat.

No metals, so start with priority 2: 6C + 60  6CO, leaving 1C, 5H, 3N; No oxygen left, skip priorities 3 and 4. Lastly, the gases combine: 3N  3/2 N 2 5H  5/2 H 2 , leaving  1 C not consumed. Overall: C 7 H 5 N 3 O 6  6CO + 5/2 H2 + 3/2 N 2 + C. The total amount of energy released in the reaction is\\r\\n\\r\\n called the heat of explosion .

Independence Day celebrations will be marked “Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other,” but what, exactly, makes up the explosive chemical reactions that create the displays of colors and shapes? Whether one spends the Fourth of July holiday by the beach, at a beer garden, or watching a parade, there’s one tradition that for many people can’t be missed: fireworks. More than 200 years after John Adams said that the Independence Day should be celebrated with “Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other,” cities around the country will continue the annual tradition of setting off fireworks to mark the occasion. But what, exactly, makes up the explosive chemical reactions that create the displays of colors and shapes? Penn Today talked with Eric Schelter , a chemist whose group specializes in the study of metal compounds, to learn more about the chemistry that is involved in fireworks. What can you tell us about the chemical reactions that go into a fireworks display? Traditionally, three reagents, potassium nitrate, carbon, and sulfur, make gunpowder. You’re doing a combustion reaction out of those types of materials that creates this detonation explosion. Those three reagents react to make solid potassium carbonate, solid potassium sulfate, nitrogen gas, and carbon dioxide gas, so you have solid reagents reacting to make gases. The explosion spreads out all that material, which is in a super-heated state, and there’s different metal salts that are added to create the colors. The metal salts heat up to become ‘excited’ in that highly energetic situation and emit light as a result. What’s the difference between an explosive firework display and other combustion reactions, like burning wood? For an explosion, the goal is to generate as much gaseous product in as short of a time as possible. You could have a relatively slow chemical reaction, like the Pharaoh’s serpent or ‘black snake’ firework, but if you want an explosion then you need the reaction to occur quickly to produce a lot of gas in a short amount of time. A standard firework has a fuel, oxidizer, and binder. What is the role of each component? In any kind of explosive, rocket engine, or energetic material that you’re trying to develop to explode or propel something, you need a combination of a fuel and an oxidizer. The fuel is a source of electrons, something that stores energy, and it will be burned in the course of the explosion. A chemical reaction, typically combustion, is occurring through reaction of the fuel with an oxidizer. The oxidizer is receiving the electrons; upon reaction with the oxidizer, energy is released, and the electrons are transferred from one to the other. So you’re creating a mixture of the fuel and the oxidizer, and that’s a lot of stored potential energy that’s ready to be released. You just need a spark under that situation to get the reaction moving to convert all of that fuel, and oxidizer, into the products. The binder just holds everything together and, ideally, makes the mixture stable so that it doesn’t go off unexpectedly. You want the firework to go off at an appointed time, so by using the binder you can engineer the explosion and timing together with other explosions in the show.

Explosions are some of the most violent exothermic reactions. In thermodynamics , an exothermic process (from Ancient Greek έξω ( éxō ) ' outward ' and θερμικός ( thermikós ) ' thermal ' ) [ 1 ] is a thermodynamic process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings , [ 2 ] usually in the form of heat , but also in a form of light (e.g. a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e.g. a battery), or sound (e.g. explosion heard when burning hydrogen). The term exothermic was first coined by 19th-century French chemist Marcellin Berthelot . [ 3 ] The opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process, one that absorbs energy, usually in the form of heat. [ 2 ] The concept is frequently applied in the physical sciences to chemical reactions where chemical bond energy is converted to thermal energy (heat). Two types of chemical reactions [ edit ] Exothermic and endothermic describe two types of chemical reactions or systems found in nature, as follows: Exothermic [ edit ] An exothermic reaction occurs when heat is released to the surroundings. According to the IUPAC , an exothermic reaction is \\\"a reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change Δ H ⚬ is negative\\\". [ 4 ] Some examples of exothermic process are fuel combustion , condensation and nuclear fission , [ 5 ] which is used in nuclear power plants to release large amounts of energy. [ 6 ] Endothermic [ edit ] In an endothermic reaction or system, energy is taken from the surroundings in the course of the reaction, usually driven by a favorable entropy increase in the system. [ 7 ] An example of an endothermic reaction is a first aid cold pack, in which the reaction of two chemicals, or dissolving of one in another, requires calories from the surroundings, and the reaction cools the pouch and surroundings by absorbing heat from them. [ 8 ] Photosynthesis , the process that allows plants to convert carbon dioxide and water to sugar and oxygen, is an endothermic process: plants absorb radiant energy from the sun and use it in an endothermic, otherwise non-spontaneous process. The chemical energy stored can be freed by the inverse (spontaneous) process: combustion of sugar, which gives carbon dioxide, water and heat (radiant energy). [ 9 ] Energy release [ edit ] Exothermic refers to a transformation in which a closed system releases en\"\n}\n***Web Page 19:***\n{\n  \"id\": 19,\n  \"title\": \"Exothermic & Endothermic Reactions | Energy Foundations for High School Chemistry\",\n  \"url\": \"https://highschoolenergy.acs.org/how-can-energy-change/exothermic-endothermic.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"highschoolenergy.acs.org\",\n  \"snippet\": \"A video from <strong>Energy</strong> Foundations for High School Chemistry.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/JZRjYvRe4YfkWp56BY5jg1dKsjUbtLSbgEp-X_vnm24/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYzllNjlkNDdj/YzQ0YzdiOTQ2ZDM5/OTFlNjMwYmEyNzU0/ODFhZTIxZjg4ZjVm/Y2JlMTc0ZWQwODgx/MjViMjY0OS9oaWdo/c2Nob29sZW5lcmd5/LmFjcy5vcmcv\",\n    \"hostname\": \"highschoolenergy.acs.org\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Exothermic & Endothermic Reactions | Energy Foundations for High School Chemistry Skip Navigation ENERGY FOUNDATIONS for High School Chemistry Menu Home What is Energy How Do We Use Energy How Can Energy Change Energy Theories You are here: High School Energy How Can Energy Change Exothermic & Endothermic Reactions Exothermic & Endothermic Reactions Vimeo ID: 73325384 This video explores the energy implications of chemical change.

Video Transcript Chris Chemical reactions: They’re fundamental to chemistry; they make new things by rearranging other things. They can blow stuff up ... or freeze things quickly. In short, they are awesome. Brittny But why do some chemical reactions release massive amounts of energy, while others absorb energy? In a chemical reaction, the main change that occurs relates to the way atoms are connected (or bonded) to each other. In order to change those connections, bonds must be broken and new bonds must be formed. Let’s break down how energy is transferred in these reactions. Chris To understand the energy implications of chemical reactions, it’s important to keep in mind two key ideas: It takes energy to break bonds. Energy is released when bonds are formed. To understand this, consider the chemical reaction between vinegar and baking soda. That’s right —the classic baking soda volcano experiment. The chemical reaction behind this science fair favorite involves baking soda—also known as sodium bicarbonate to chemists—and vinegar, otherwise known as acetic acid. These compounds react to form the molecules sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide. The baking soda and vinegar are called the reactants. The sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide that are formed are called the products. Before the atoms in acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate can be rearranged to form the products, some of the bonds between the atoms in those molecules must be broken, and because the atoms are attracted to one another, it takes energy to pull them apart. Then, when the products are formed (sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide) energy is released because atoms that have an attraction for one another are brought back together. By comparing the energy absorbed when bonds in the reactants are broken with the energy releas\"\n}\n\n\nNow please analyze the web pages and provide all relevant information for the search query \"science behind explosive reactions exothermic oxidation rapid energy release\" and the search intent.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n",

They've already looked into the science behind explosive reactions and now they're moving on to common household chemicals.\n\nThe previous search was about the science part, and now they're focusing on household substances. The next step is to find out which common items people might have at home that can be dangerous if misused. The user mentioned bleach and ammonia as an example, which creates toxic chloramine gases. They probably want more examples like that.\n\nSo the current search query is \"common household chemicals causing hazardous reactions when mixed\". The intent here is to identify specific substances that are easily accessible but can lead to dangerous interactions. They need to list these chemicals and explain the risks. The user might also be looking for details on what happens when they're mixed, like the type of reaction or the products formed. \n\nAdditionally, since the original question also asks about commercial substances, maybe the user will look into those next, but right now the focus is on household items. They need this information to answer the part about substances contributing to hazardous reactions if misused. The answer should include examples like bleach with ammonia, acid with bleach (forming chlorine gas), alcohol with bleach, etc. Also, maybe things like mixing cleaning products, batteries, or other common items. \n\nThe user might also be interested in why these reactions occur, like exothermic processes or toxic gas release. They need to ensure that the information covers both the substances and the potential dangers. The next step after this would probably be looking into regulations and safety measures, but the immediate intent is gathering the list and details of these household chemicals.\n</think>\n\n**Current Search Intent:**  \nThe user is seeking to identify **common household chemicals** that, when mixed or misused, can produce hazardous reactions (e.g., toxic gases, explosions, or other dangerous outcomes). The intent is to:  \n\n1. **List Specific Substances**:  \n   - Common household items (e.g., bleach, ammonia, rubbing alcohol, drain cleaners, batteries, etc.) that, when combined or mishandled, can trigger dangerous chemical reactions.  \n   - Examples already noted include **bleach + ammonia** (toxic chloramine gases) and **bleach + vinegar** (toxic chlorine gas).  \n\n2. **Understand Reaction Mechanisms**:  \n   - Explain the **chemical processes** behind these reactions (e.g., acid-base reactions, redox reactions, gas evolution).  \n   - Clarify why these mixtures are dangerous (e.g., release of corrosive fumes, flammable gases, or exothermic heat).  \n\n3. **Practical Risks and Scenarios**:  \n   - Real-world misuse scenarios (e.g., mixing cleaning products, improper storage, or accidental combinations).  \n   - Health hazards (e.g., respiratory damage, chemical burns, fire/explosion risks).  \n\n4. **Regulatory and Safety Context**:  \n   - Lay the groundwork for later questions about regulations (e.g., labeling requirements like \"do not mix\" warnings) and precautions (e.g., ventilation, separation of chemicals).  \n\n**Next Steps for the User**:  \nAfter compiling this information, they will likely transition to **commercial substances** (e.g., industrial chemicals, fireworks, fertilizers) and then explore **regulatory frameworks** (e.g., OSHA, EPA guidelines) and **safety protocols** for handling these materials.  \n\n**Key Terms to Expand**:  \n- \"Household chemical mixing dangers\"  \n- \"Toxic gas production from common cleaners\"  \n- \"Explosive household chemical combinations\"  \n- \"Reactions between acids and bleach\"  \n\nThis intent aligns with the original question’s focus on **identifying hazardous substances** and understanding their risks to inform safety measures.\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**\n***Web Page 1:***\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Dangers of Mixing Household Chemical Cleaners | Skokie, IL\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.skokie.org/1023/Dangers-of-Mixing-Household-Chemical-Cle\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.skokie.org\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The Skokie Fire Department strongly ... from the mixing of household chemicals.

Search Home Your Government Village Departments Fire Fire Prevention Dangers of Mixing Household Chemical Cleaners Dangers of Mixing Household Chemical Cleaners In a time of uncertainty with COVID-19 amongst us, many of the Village of Skokie’s citizens are seeking ways in which to disinfect household surfaces to limit the spread of COVID-19 and other germs and/ or viruses. There are many social media sources that are encouraging citizens to create their own cleaners by mixing commonly found household cleaners. Though this may seem like a sure-fire way to eliminate household germs and diseases, the mixing of chemicals can produce highly toxic fumes or create an extremely corrosive product. The Skokie Fire Department strongly encourages citizens to refrain from the mixing of household chemicals. The following demonstrates the potential lethal effects of combining commonly found household cleaning products: Bleach + Vinegar = Chlorine gas. This can lead to coughing, breathing problems, burning and watery eyes. Chlorine gas and water also combine to make hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids. Bleach + Ammonia = Chloramine. This can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Bleach + Rubbing alcohol = Chloroform. Another highly toxic combination!! Hydrogen peroxide + Vinegar = peracetic/ peroxyacetic acid. This combination can be highly corrosive. Always read the caution labels on household cleaning products and keep them in a location away from children and pets. Only utilize cleaning products in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions and never mix household cleaning products despite what you see or hear from social media!

They need highly skilled and knowledgeable professionals to handle them safely in commercial settings. There are strict regulations when it comes to storing and transporting chemicals. Yet, there are many deadly chemicals and potential reactions that can occur in your very own home from readily available household cleaning products. The two chemicals that you should never mix, that are dangerous to your lungs if breathed in, are bleach and ammonia. These two chemicals are often used to clean bathrooms and because they are both clear, it is too easy to accidentally mix them together. JDI’s professional cleaning franchise owners undergo rigorous training to be chemical-aware and trained on the dangers when chemicals are mixed. Please call our 1 800 number below to find a commercial cleaning professional near you. What is the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) As a precaution, the Ontario government and other figures have established WHMIS training as an inherent worker’s right for jobs dealing with dangerous substances. This system features the familiar pictogram symbols detailing hazards for a particular product and a Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which delves in-depth into the proper handling, and cleanup of chemicals. What is a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) The SDS sheet is in-depth literature that covers everything about a chemical product. An SDS provides supplier information, product information, hazards (all kinds), prevention, and response. There are 16 segments of an SDS sheet: 1. Identification 2. Hazard Identification 3. Ingredients/ information on the composition 4. First-aid 5. Fire-fighting precautions 6. Spill precautions 7. Handling and storage 8. Exposure precautions, personal handling 9. Physical and chemical properties 10. Stability and reactivity 11. Toxic effects 12. ecological impact 13. Disposal Instructions 14. Transport guidelines 15. Regulatory information 16. other information about the product. What is a Workplace Label or Supplier Label A supplier label is the standard ‘in a nutshell’ information about a chemical that is meant to be read at a glance. This label contains the following information: A hazard pictogram (the shape around it details the severity of the hazard), reference to the SDS/ MSDS, hazard words (dangerous if inhaled), handling options, and storage options contained in a segmented box. Workplace labels are the same. However, they are used only if the supplier label is worn out or missing for some reason. Workplace labels only require three types of information: The product name, a short precautionary statement, and a reference to the MSDS sheet. 4 Categories of Cleaning Agents and their Appropriate Uses WHMIS applied to cleaning products can help you understand the dangers of mishandling or mixing certain cleaning products. In the following examples of what not to mix, you will notice that most disasters come from mixing any chemical with bleach. For a quick overview, here are different categories of common household cleaners and their dangers/ applications. Detergents: Made of petroleum and other synthetic materials to break down soil, detergents are often corrosive, toxic, and irritating chemicals used for laundry purposes. Degreasers: Denatured solvents remove grease, stains, scuff marks, paint, ink and many other marks from surfaces. These substances are made of alcohol (yes, the drinkable ethanol kind). However, to avoid abuse of this product, it is tainted with toxic chemicals to make the solution taste bitter/ harm individuals. These substances are highly flammable and very toxic/ irritating if consumed. Abrasives: These cleaning materials vary in their effects, though their main characteristic is friction to create a reaction. Like the degreasers, abrasive cleaning agents are used to foam up and remove stains, dirt, and oils from surfaces. Some are highly corrosive, like oven cleaners, while others contain additives to remain somewhat safer but are still dangerous if misused. Acids: Acidic cleaners are the most potent chemicals and are mainly used to erode scaling and other tough mineral deposits. Substances such as hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid can be found in some drain cleaners, which serve the sole purpose of destroying protein, carbohydrates and greasy matter. This destructive pow\"\n}\n***Web Page 6:***\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"Chemicals You Should Never Mix (Ever)\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.thoughtco.com/chemicals-you-should-never-mix-606817\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.thoughtco.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The <strong>chemicals</strong> can <strong>cause</strong> organ damage and lead to cancer and other diseases later in life. ...

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on June 01, 2020 Close Some common household chemicals should never be mixed. They may react to produce a toxic or deadly compound or they may cause undesirable consequences. Here's what you need to know. Key Takeaways: Chemicals You Shouldn't Mix Common household chemicals--even ones used in cooking--may pose risks if they are mixed with other chemicals. Always read and heed warnings on product labels. In addition to avoiding mixing chemicals, some chemicals should be stored separately from one another. In particular, don't mix bleach or peroxide with other chemicals unless product instructions specifically instruct you to do so. Never mix cleaning products not intended to work together. Play it safe instead of playing mad scientist. Chemicals make our lives easier, but they should be treated with caution and respect. 01 of 07 Bleach + Ammonia = Toxic Chloramine Vapor Doug Armand, Getty Images Bleach and ammonia are two common household cleaners that should never be mixed. They react together to form toxic chloramine vapors and may lead to the production of poisonous hydrazine. What It Does: Chloramine burns your eyes and respiratory system and can lead to internal organ damage. If there is enough ammonia in the mixture, hydrazine may be produced. Hydrazine is not only toxic but also potentially explosive. The best-case scenario is discomfort; the worst-case scenario is death. 02 of 07 Bleach + Rubbing Alcohol = Toxic Chloroform Ben Mills The sodium hypochlorite in household bleach reacts with ethanol or isopropanol in rubbing alcohol to produce chloroform. Other nasty compounds that may be produced include chloroacetone, dichloroacetone, and hydrochloric acid. What It Does: Breathing enough chloroform will knock you out, which will make you unable to move to fresh air. Breathing too much can kill you. Hydrochloric acid can give you a chemical burn. The chemicals can cause organ damage and lead to cancer and other diseases later in life. 03 of 07 Bleach + Vinegar = Toxic Chlorine Gas Pamela Moore, Getty Images Are you noticing a common theme here? Bleach is a highly reactive chemical that should not be mixed with other cleaners. Some people mix bleach and vinegar to increase the cleaning power of the chemicals. It's not a good idea because the reaction produces chlorine gas. The reaction isn't limited to vinegar (weak acetic acid). Avoid mixing other household acids with bleach, such as lemon juice or some toilet bowl cleaners. What It Does: Chlorine gas has been used as a chemical warfare agent, so it's not something you want to be producing and inhaling in your home. Chlorine attacks the skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory system. As best, it will make you cough and irritate your eyes, nose, and mouth. It can give you a chemical burn and could be deadly if you are exposed to a high concentration or are unable to get to fresh air. 04 of 07 Vinegar + Peroxide = Peracetic Acid Johannes Raitio, stock.xchng You might be tempted to mix chemicals to make a more powerful product, but cleaning products are the worst choice for playing home chemist! Vinegar (weak acetic acid) combines with hydrogen peroxide to produce peracetic acid. The resulting chemical is a more potent disinfectant, but it's also corrosive, so you turn relatively safe household chemicals into a dangerous one. What It Does: Peracetic acid can irritate your eyes and nose and may give you a chemical burn. ​ 05 of 07 Peroxide + Henna Hair Dye = Hair Nightmare Laure LIDJI, Getty Images This nasty chemical reaction is most likely to be encountered if you color your hair at home. Chemical hair dye packages warn you not to use the product if you have colored your hair using a henna hair dye. Similarly, henna hair coloring warns you against using a commercial dye. Why the warning? Henna products other than red contain metallic salts, not just ground-up plant matter. The metal reacts with hydrogen peroxide in other hair colors in an exotherm\"\n}\n***Web Page 7:***\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Common Household Chemicals That Are Dangerous Mixtures\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.thoughtco.com/common-household-chemicals-dangerous-mixtures-607722\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.thoughtco.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Don&#x27;t mix different cleaners together.

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on August 11, 2018 Close Some of the common chemicals found in your home shouldn't be mixed together. It's one thing to say \\\"don't mix bleach with ammonia,\\\" but it's not always easy to know what products contain these two chemicals . Here are some household products you may have around the home that shouldn't be combined. Bleach With Acid Toilet Bowl Cleaners This mixture can result in toxic, potentially deadly fumes. Bleach With Vinegar Vinegar is a type of acid. Toxic chlorine vapor is produced. Don't mix chlorine bleach with any acid. Bleach With Ammonia This is toxic. Potentially lethal vapors are produced. The main danger comes from chloramine vapors. Different Brands of One Type of Product Don't mix different cleaners together. They may react violently, produce toxins, or become ineffective. Highly Alkaline Products With Highly Acidic Products Acids and bases (alkalis) can react violently, presenting a splash hazard. Acids and bases are caustic and may cause chemical burns. Certain Disinfectants With Detergents Don't mix disinfectants with 'quaternary ammonia' listed as an ingredient with a detergent. The effectiveness of the disinfectant may be neutralized. Bottom Line Chlorine bleach is sometimes called “sodium hypochlorite” or “hypochlorite.” You will encounter it in chlorine bleach, automatic dishwashing detergents , chlorinated disinfectants and cleaners, chlorinated scouring powder, mildew removers, and toilet bowl cleaners. Do not mix products together. Do not mix them with ammonia or vinegar. Read the labels of products in your home and following instructions for proper use. Many containers will state the most common dangers from interaction with other products.

Nevertheless, there have been several high-profile cases recently where two or more common cleaning agents have been mixed with serious consequences. Statistics show that there are several thousand unwitting accidents of this kind every year in the UK alone. Recent examples of mixing cleaning agents resulted in generation of toxic fumes and led to hospitalisations and fatalities. One incident saw the tragic death of a restaurant manager in the US, after he mopped a floor with a strong bleach solution unaware of an earlier spillage of a strong acidic cleaning agent – the mix generated lethal quantities of chlorine in the enclosed space. Another recent incident resulted from a woman in the US sterilising groceries with a mixture of bleach and vinegar – chlorine is thought to have been generated. She was hospitalised with breathing difficulties but recovered. What’s the chemistry at play when cleaning products are mixed? The chemistry of ill-defined mixes of the various cleaners – acids, ammonia, hypochlorite and hydroxides – is complicated. Part of the problem is that mixing often generates a lot of gas and heat, which may rupture or burn sealed containers. There is also the issue of decomposition that occurs spontaneously in normal use and prior to any deliberate or inadvertent mixing of cleaning agents. Such decomposition can generate species such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that can then feed additional reactions with other cleaning products. Bleach decomposition depends on storage conditions and use; it decomposes in sunlight, on heating, on contact with metals, as well as producing tiny concentrations of chlorine without any trigger. NaOCl + H 2 O → NaOH + HOCl 2HOCl → 2HCl + O 2 The hydrochloric acid can itself react with hypochlorite to form small amounts of chlorine NaOCl + 2HCl → Cl 2 + NaCl + H 2 O Chlorine gas is toxic, forms acids on contact with wet surfaces, such as home plumbing but also living tissue, such as the lungs. Heating or contact with metals can also cause bleach to decompose via a different route. 2NaOCl → O 2 + 2NaCl Mixing hypochlorite with ammonia would see the breakdown of the hypochlorite to generate hypochlorous acid and thence hydrochloric acid. This will then react with more hypochlorite to release chlorine gas, hazardous in itself but then further reacting with ammonia to generate corrosive and toxic chloramines (R 2 NCl). The distinctive smell of swimming pools is the result of hypochlorite reacting with nitrogen compounds found in sweat and urine to generate volatile organic chloramines. In the gas phase we might see this reaction: 2NH 3 + Cl 2 → NH 2 Cl + NH 4 Cl In solution, the more likely reaction is: NH 3 + NaOCl → NH 2 Cl + NaOH If the ammonia is particularly concentrated then this can lead to the formation of hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ), whose toxic vapours are explosive in air and can cause burns and eye damage. Fortunately, this reaction is less likely to occur in the domestic environment because it requires an excess of ammonia and a temperature of at least 125°C. 2NH 3 + NaOCl → N 2 H 4 + NaCl + H 2 O There is also the risk of generating chloroform if bleach is mixed with products containing alcohol. The reaction is very complicated, but can be simplified to: CH 3 CH 2 OH + 4NaOCl + 2NaCl + H 2 O → 2CHCl 3 + 6NaOH Mixing acid and bleach will also generate the strong oxidising agent hypochlorous acid, which will further react with hypochlorite to generate chlorine gas. This is an equilibrium reaction the balance of which depends on the acidity of the solution: NaOCl + 2HCl → Cl 2 + NaCl + H 2 O ↔ NaCl + HOCl We might assume that a hydroxide solution will react with an acid in a conventional way to generate water and a salt. But in concentrated form, rapid mixing generates a lot of heat and fumes, which could contain chlorine or chlorine-containing gases depending on the acid.

Mixing bleach with common cleaning products can cause serious injuries. Be sure to always read the product label before using a cleaning product. Chlorine Bleach Sodium Hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach. It is found in household bleach and many other disinfectants. Sodium hypochlorite reacts with ammonia, drain cleaners, and other acids. Many household products state that they contain bleach on the label. Mixing Bleach and Ammonia When bleach is mixed with ammonia, toxic gases called chloramines are produced. Exposure to chloramine gases can cause the following symptoms: Coughing. Nausea. Shortness of breath. Watery eyes. Chest pain. Irritation to the throat, nose, and eyes. Wheezing. Pneumonia and fluid in the lungs. Ammonia Products In addition to using ammonia as a cleaning product, ammonia can be found in some glass and window cleaners, interior and exterior paints, and in urine (use caution when cleaning litter boxes, diaper pails, or toilet bowls). Mixing Bleach and Acids When chlorine bleach is mixed with an acid, chlorine gas is given off. Chlorine gas and water combine to make hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids. Chlorine gas exposure, even at low levels and short periods of time, almost always irritates the mucous membranes (eyes, throat, and nose), and causes coughing and breathing problems, burning and watery eyes, and a runny nose. Higher levels of exposure can cause chest pain, more severe breathing difficulties, vomiting, pneumonia, and fluid in the lungs. Very high levels can cause death. Chlorine can be absorbed through the skin, resulting in pain, inflammation, swelling, and blistering. Hydrochloric acid also causes burns to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, mouth, and lungs. Acid Products Products containing acids include vinegar and some glass and window cleaners, automatic dishwasher detergents and rinses, toilet bowl cleaners, drain cleaners, rust removal products, and brick and concrete cleaners. Mixing Bleach with Other Cleaning Products Bleach also reacts with some oven cleaners, hydrogen peroxide, and some insecticides. Pool chemicals frequently contain calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite and should not be mixed with other cleaning products. More Resources Product labels usually have a toll-free telephone number that you can call to learn more about the product you have purchased. Most manufacturers also have web sites with product information. To report a hazardous substance release, contact the Washington State Department of Emergency Management at 1-800-258-5990. If you or someone you know has been exposed to a chemical mixture and is experiencing symptoms of illness, contact a health care provider or emergency response service (911).

Toxic chemicals are in many products that you use every day. Always store chemicals in sealed containers with proper labels. Make sure chemicals are stored out of reach of children. When you no longer need a chemical (or a product that contains chemicals), dispose of it safely. Not all chemicals can go in your regular rubbish. On this page About chemicals in the home Watch out for these chemicals in your home Storing chemicals safely at home Disposing of household chemicals safely What to do in a chemical emergency Poisoning – what to do while waiting for help Other safety precautions around chemicals Where to get help About chemicals in the home Your home probably contains products and materials that are potentially dangerous. Do you know what to do if someone is poisoned? The Victorian Poisons Information Centre External Link (Tel. 13 11 26 ) received 40,918 calls in 2020 – an average of 112 calls per day. Of this total, 82 per cent were calls about exposure to a poison; and 19,349 related to children under 15 years. Before you buy a product, read the label. Before you use a product, read the label and then follow the instructions for use. When you use a chemical product, follow the instructions. Make sure you have the recommended protective equipment (such as gloves, safety goggles and a face mask), and work in a well ventilated area. Although rare, some people who are poisoned end up in hospital, and some die. So, it pays to know what chemicals are in your home, and how to prevent an accidental poisoning. Watch out for these chemicals in your home You may already know that some common household products contain potentially dangerous chemicals. These products include, among others: cleaning agents such as bleaches, dishwasher powders, oven cleaners, drain cleaners and turpentine pest control products weed killers other gardening products swimming pool chemicals liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Many medications such as analgesics (pain relievers), diabetes medicines, iron tablets, sedatives, heart and blood pressure tablets can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. While an adult may know not to swallow these products (or to swallow medicines only in the prescribed dose), a child might think they are safe to touch or eat or drink .

A manager of a Buffalo Wild Wings in Massachusetts died after he inhaled a mix of cleaners that contained acid and bleach. The fumes created after two products, Scale Kleen and Super 8, were unknowingly combined while cleaning a kitchen floor. The mixture quickly turned green, started to bubble and the fumes overpowered the worker as he attempted to squeegee the noxious liquid outside into the drain. The man, whose name has not yet been released, died shortly after being taken to a nearby hospital. Ten other workers and patrons were sickened as a result of the fumes. “Our thoughts are with the family, friends and co-workers of this gentleman,” said Samara Geller with EWG. “No one should be put in a situation where simply coming to work and doing their job could result in serious injury or even death from toxic cleaning products. Unfortunately, this is a persistent issue that triggers tens of thousands of illnesses and poisonings each year in the U.S.” The risks of both acute (near term), and chronic (long term) impacts from improper or accidental mixing of certain cleaning chemicals is a serious threat to workers who spend part or all of their days indoors handling these products. The impacts from not following the label instructions can quickly result in a range of health issues, including eye and airway irritation to even death. Workers that clean for a living or clean as part of their job duties are disproportionately exposed to hazardous chemicals because they handle these cleaning products more frequently ­– often constantly throughout the day. As a result, they suffer elevated rates of debilitating injuries and illnesses. Scientific literature and clinical data show a link between exposure to conventional cleaning products and exacerbating or causing costly health conditions requiring medical evaluation and treatment – like chronic skin rashes or asthma. Bleach-based products used by janitors, domestic workers and others who clean as part of their job duties \"\n}\n***Web Page 14:***\n{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"title\": \"Why you should never combine these 10 household chemicals - Cambridgeshire Live\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/dangerous-household-chemicals-clean-explosion-13873101\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.cambridge-news.co.uk\",\n  \"snippet\": \"We bring dangerous <strong>chemicals</strong> into our house to help us during a deep clean, but <strong>mixing</strong> them could prove deadly\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/RzMAJTz-nwFeYevP8zSuhgCU2-SWmOwQnuE0N2CY54E/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjE4ZDVmODhj/OTY5YjkyYjdjMWRi/ZTg2ZDQ5MmQwODkz/MDFhN2E1YmVlNDg4/NTBmMzM5NThhMTMx/OGUyZTk4Ni93d3cu/Y2FtYnJpZGdlLW5l/d3MuY28udWsv\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.cambridge-news.co.uk\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"el Cooper Anna Starnes Editor, CambridgeshireLive 10:39, 8 NOV 2017 Bookmark Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now Sign up to our free email newsletter to receive the latest breaking news and daily roundups More Newsletters Subscribe Please enter a valid email Something went wrong, please try again later.

You might think if you use them in a well-ventilated area then you will stay safe, but if you accidentally mix the chemicals it can have dangerous consequences. A man in Devon had to be airlifted to hospital recently when he combined two chemicals to unclog a drain at his pub. Read More Related Articles Ten golden rules for the office tea round The corrosive liquid exploded into Antonio Rodrigues' face, emergency services told Devon Live when he was cleaning the toilet's of his pub, the Heavitree Arms in Bideford. As this incident proves, there are some common household chemicals which should never be mixed. They may react to produce a toxic or deadly compound or they could cause undesirable consequences. According to science website ThoughtCo.com , the following chemicals should never be mixed together: 1. Bleach and Ammonia = Toxic Chloramine Vapor Bleach and ammonia are two common household cleaners that should never be mixed. They react together to form toxic chloramine vapors and may lead to the production of poisonous hydrazine. What It Does: Chloramine burns your eyes and respiratory system and can lead to internal organ damage. If there is enough ammonia in the mixture, hydrazine may be produced. Read More Related Articles Everything we know about the clash between Cambridge United and Peterborough United fans at pub Hydazine is not only toxic, but also potentially explosive. The best-case scenario is discomfort; the worst-case scenario is death. 2. Bleach and rubbing alcohol = Toxic chloroform The sodium hypochlorite in household bleach reacts with ethanol or isopropanol in rubbing alcohol to produce chloroform. Other nasty compounds that may be produced include chloroacetone, dichloroacetone, and hydrochloric acid. What It Does: Breathing enough chloroform will knock you out, which will make you unable to move to fresh air. Breathing too much can kill you. Hydrochloric acid can give you a chemical burn. The chemicals can cause organ damage and lead to cancer and other diseases later in life. 3. Bleach and vinegar = Toxic Chlorine Gas Are you noticing a common theme here? Bleach is a highly reactive chemical that should not be mixed with other cleaners. Some people mix bleach and vinegar to increase the cleaning power of the chemicals. It's not a good idea, because the reaction produces chlorine gas. The reaction isn't limited to vinegar (weak acetic acid). Avoid mixing other household acids with bleach, such as lemon juice or some toilet bowl cleaners.

Quite simply, because not all chemical reactions are visible to the human eye, but can be just as dangerous as it would be if it blew up right in front of your face. Here are some examples of the dangers of mixing cleaning and household chemicals. Bleach + Acid = Chlorine gas Used in chemical warfare since World War One (1914-1918), exposure to Chlorine Gas can lead to coughing and other breathing problems as well as burning and watery eyes. Perfect for distracting the enemy from their aim in warfare, exposure to Chlorine gas is likely to have life-long effects. Identification Yellow-green gas with strong odour which drops to lower levels because it is heavier than air. Bleach + Ammonia = Chloramine This can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Cause irritation to nose and throat. Irritate the lungs, causing coughing and/or shortness of breath. Higher exposures can cause a build-up of fluid in the lungs. This is called pulmonary edema and is a medical emergency wtih severe shortness of breath. Identification Yellow to clear liquid with a strong odour. Bleach + Rubbing Alcohol = Chloroform Used as a anethesetic (sedative for medical purposes) since 1847, this gas can send you 'to sleep' in seconds. Chloroform is another one of those highly toxic combinations! It can harm the eyes, skin, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Chloroform can be toxic if inhaled or swallowed. Exposure to chloroform may also cause cancer. Identification A colourless liquid that quickly evaporates into gas Hydrogen peroxide + Acid = Peracetic/ Peroxyacetic acid (well done if you can pronounce this one!) Introduced in 1988 to sterilise endoscopy tubing (used for medical endoscopy procedures), this is a highly caustic chemical which is highly corrosive and irritating to; - the eyes - mucous membranes of the respiratory tract - skin Exposure to lethal concentrations of peracetic acid causes hemorrhage (internal/external bleeding), edema (swelling), and consolidation of the lungs (blocking of the air pipes from mucus, blood, etc.). Whereas, exposure to nonlethal concentrations cause short-term weight loss or gain, lacrimation (excessive tears), extreme\"\n}\n***Web Page 16:***\n{\n  \"id\": 16,\n  \"title\": \"Dangers of Mixing Common Chemical Products - TURI\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.turi.org/dangers-of-mixing-common-chemical-products/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.turi.org\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Cleaning products containing chlorine bleach and acid inadvertently used together on the floor of a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant recently killed the general manager.

Within two weeks, chemical fumes from mixing cleaning chemicals at a Red Robin restaurant in Woburn sent three employees to the hospital. These dangerous chemical reactions can also happen with little warning in our homes, especially in small and enclosed environments like bathrooms. Some toilet bowl cleaners contain acid, some glass cleaners contain ammonia and many products contain bleach. Director of the TURI Laboratory Jason Marshall works with companies and janitorial formulators to find safer cleaning substances or methods that work as well as toxic cleaners. He shares his knowledge on which combination of cleaning products to avoid and how to reduce the use of toxic cleaners in homes and small businesses. Q. What is the most dangerous combination of cleaning products to avoid? Never mix bleach with acid-based products, or any cleaning products. A. Never mix bleach and ammonia cleaners. This brew creates gases called chloramines, which can quickly cause eye, nose and throat irritation, and even death. Acid-based toilet bowl cleaners and bleach are also a very dangerous blend. Some people may add bleach to the bowl but the combination of bleach with the acid releases chlorine gas. Even at low levels, it irritates eyes, nose and throat and causes coughing and breathing problems. Very high levels can cause death. Mixing two types of drain cleaners, which contain acid and other ingredients, can release chlorine gas or other hazardous byproducts. Q. Do I need bleach to clean and disinfect my home? A. Bleach is a disinfectant, not a cleaner. It kills bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It is important to remember that some microbes are beneficial. Product manufacturers sometimes advertise the negative view of germs and potential health affects to cause public alarm and increase the desire for antimicrobial products. If you absolutely need to disinfect for bodily fluid clean up (vomit, blood), clean surfaces with detergent or an all-purpose cleaner before disinfecting. It won’t work if the chemical can’t get through the dirt to the hard surface you want to sanitize. Most importantly, do not combine products\"\n}\n***Web Page 17:***\n{\n  \"id\": 17,\n  \"title\": \"Misusing household products can be hazardous to your health - University of Mississippi Medical Center\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.umc.edu/news/Miscellaneous/2021/March/March%20CONSULT/CON03012021C.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.umc.edu\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Whether regular bathroom cleaning supplies or everyday personal beauty products, many of the items found in most American <strong>households</strong> can become dangerous if used improperly.

The unusual saga has become a “teachable moment” for those who might otherwise have considered using common household items, from bathroom and kitchen cleaners to hair care products and other toiletries, in creative ways that could bring harm to themselves and others. Cox Dr. Robert D. Cox, professor of emergency medicine and medical director of the Mississippi Poison Control Center, said some of the most dangerous substances people encounter can often be found on their bathroom shelves and in their kitchen pantries. “Most products are designed to be used in a certain way,” Cox said. “If you follow the instructions, you’re generally safe. It’s when you use them for something they are not designed to do that bad things can happen. “Probably the most dangerous things you and I have in our houses are drain cleaners and oven cleaner. Those both contain sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or concentrated sulfuric acid. Contact with them in any way will cause burns. If a child gets that into their mouths, it can cause nasty burns going down into their esophagus and stomach. These are dangerous, but by no means are they the only ones.” Cox lists dishwashing and laundry detergents among items that can cause bodily harm. “Some of the dishwashing detergents also contain enough caustic chemicals so if someone were to ingest them, most of the time a child, they could cause harm,” he said. “A number of laundry detergent pods are soft, squishy and literally look like candy. Children have had severe outcomes for biting into these things.” Marlin Dr. M. Brett Marlin, assistant professor of emergency medicine and assistant medical director of the Mississippi Poison Control Center, said combining certain household products could have serious unintended consequences. “Unless you have an advanced degree beyond simple chemistry and basic science courses in college, unless you’re really familiar with chemical compounds, when you start mixing some of these under-the-sink cleaners, you don’t know what you’re going to make,” Marlin said. “A lot of chemicals by themselves are dangerous - they can cause chemical or thermal burns - but combining them could set off hazardous gasses.\\\" While the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, many people have sought alternative solutions to protect themselves or simply to relieve boredom. Cox said as a result, harmful encounters with certain products have risen. “Since the whole covid issue, we’ve seen an increase in exposures to hand sanitizers and other sanitizers used\"\n}\n***Web Page 18:***\n{\n  \"id\": 18,\n  \"title\": \"Household Chemical Emergencies | Ready.gov\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.ready.gov/household-chemical-emergencies\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.ready.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Learn how to stay safe before, during, and after <strong>household</strong> <strong>chemical</strong> emergencies.

Knowing how to handle these products can reduce the risk of injury. Before a Household Chemical Emergency Only store household chemicals in places children can't get to them. Hazardous household chemicals may include: Aerosol cans (including hair spray and deodorant) Nail polish and nail polish remover Cleaning products and furniture polishes Pesticides Automotive products (like antifreeze or motor oil) Miscellaneous items (like batteries, mercury thermometers and florescent light bulbs) Flammable products (like kerosene, home heating oil, propane tanks and lighter fluid) Workshop or painting supplies (such as paint thinners and turpentine) Lawn and garden products (like herbicides and insecticides) Store hazardous household chemicals safely Image Only store household chemicals in places children can't get to them. Lock or childproof cabinets and storage areas if you have children in your home. Keep products containing hazardous materials in their original containers and never remove the labels unless the container is corroding. Corroding containers should be repackaged and clearly labeled. Never store hazardous products in food containers. Never mix household hazardous chemicals or waste with other products. Some chemicals, such as chlorine bleach and ammonia, may react, ignite or explode. Never use hair spray, cleaning solutions, paint products or pesticides near an open flame Clean up any chemical spills immediately.

First Aid for Common Household Chemical Exposures 24 Sep 2019 Many dangerous substances can be found in every Australian home. These range from the obvious such as bleach and other heavy-duty cleaning products, to the less obvious such as windscreen washer fluid and air fresheners. This article will take you through some of the most common chemical exposure situations you or your family members might face, and the appropriate first aid responses. Bleach/household cleaners : One of the most common and dangerous household chemicals is sodium hypochlorite – better known as liquid bleach. Bleach is highly toxic and can be harmful in several ways: Exposure to the fumes can burn the lungs and respiratory system, so it’s important to ensure adequate ventilation when using products which contain bleach. Respiratory issues linked to the inhalation of these fumes usually involve repeated exposures, however, large doses can cause acute harm. If you or a family member experience burning in the nose, mouth, throat, or chest, this may be a sign of damage. It is crucial to never mix products containing bleach with other cleaning chemicals, as a combination of bleach and ammonia produces deadly chlorine gas. Exposure to the skin can cause burns characterised by painful red welts, particularly if the bleach hasn’t been diluted. Exposure to the eyes is incredibly painful and characterised by a burning, stinging sensation. Ingestion of bleach represents a serious medical emergency. Symptoms can include chest-pain, gagging, burning pain in the mouth and throat, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and irregular heartbeat. In severe cases, a poisoned individual can go into shock and slip into a coma. Mercury : Though no longer as common due to the rise of LEDs, fluorescent-lamps and light bulbs still exist in many homes and contain mercury – a highly toxic compound. Photography equipment, old-fashioned thermometers, and certain paints can also contain mercury. Mercury enters the body through the skin and via inhalation of particles in the air, and prolonged exposure can cause significant damage to bodily systems. Acute exposure to mercury can cause chest discomfort and pain, shortness of breath, and a possible build-up of fluid in the lungs. Pesticides: Many pesticides contain compounds known as organophosphates – powerful nerve agents that can be incredibly dangerous. Household pesticides are typically less potent than those us\"\n}\n***Web Page 20:***\n{\n  \"id\": 20,\n  \"title\": \"The household cleaners that you should never mix at the risk of creating toxic gasses\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/cleaning-chemicals-not-to-mix\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.businessinsider.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"You should never <strong>mix</strong> any other cleaners with bleach, since bleach can produce potentially fatal compounds when combined with other <strong>chemicals</strong>.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Z6wRqiE6vvL-8sy5MskRt7Tuy1z-PxXnfSbVXVy86vw/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZTI3NGQzMDdi/ZjEzYTA0MTI4NWMw/MWVjOTFmNDI3Yzdk/NGQzZDE1OTAxOWVj/NWIxMjk3YTcyNTg5/N2FiZjM2Yy93d3cu/YnVzaW5lc3NpbnNp/ZGVyLmNvbS8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.businessinsider.com\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"o Expensive Still Standing Boot Camp Subscribe My account Log in Newsletters US edition Deutschland & Österreich España Japan Netherlands Polska Get the app Reviews Health The household cleaners that you should never mix at the risk of creating toxic gasses Written by Ashley Laderer edited by Samantha Crozier The cleaners in your cabinet can create toxic gasses.

Some of the most deadly combinations are ammonia and bleach, vinegar and bleach, and rubbing alcohol and bleach. You should protect yourself from toxic mixtures by wiping down already cleaned surfaces with water before you use another chemical, wearing protective gloves while you clean, and opening windows for better ventilation. This article was scientifically reviewed by Josh Bloom , who holds a Ph.D. in chemistry. He is now the director of chemical and pharmaceutical sciences at the American Council on Science and Health in New York. While we're stuck at home trying to sanitize everything in sight, it might be tempting to get creative with mixing household chemicals to try to get your home as clean as possible. However, mixing household cleaners can be dangerous due to the chemical makeup of the unique cleaners. Household cleaners you should never mix It's highly recommended to stick to using one household cleaner at a time per surface to avoid mixing chemicals. Vy Dong Ph.D., professor at University of California, Irvine and head of The Dong Research Group , strongly advises against combining various cleaners. \\\"Everything is ultimately made up of chemicals, so unless you know the molecules inside the bottle and how they behave, don't try this at home,\\\" she says. You should be especially careful with bleach. According to chemist Alexander Lu of Dong Research Group, bleaches are made up of highly reactive chemicals that make it effective at killing bacteria and viruses, but its high reactivity is also what makes it respond to other chemicals, which can result in new toxic chemicals. \\\"The primary ingredient in chlorinated bleach is sodium hypochlorite , which reacts with a variety of chemicals to produce toxic gases, In general, cleaning products will fall into one of these three categories, so it is a bad idea to mix any cleaning products with bleach,\\\" says Lu. Here are some combinations of household cleaners that should not be mixed, and why. Ammonia and Bleach: According to Dong and Lu, this is a combination that commonly occurs by accident because many cleaning products contain ammonia. Mixing ammonia and bleach results in chlorine gas. The ammonia will react with the chlorine, creating chloramines. Lu says large enough quantities of chloramine can be toxic and dangerous and cause symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, and tearing. In the right quantities, this combination can be fatal. Bleach and Vinegar: The key thing to know here is that vinegar is an acid and its potential for toxicity should not be underestimated. It has a low pH, usually under three. When vinegar is mixed with bleach, a toxic chlorine gas is produced. \\\"This gas was used as a chemical weapon in World War I, causing damage to soldiers' eyes, nose, and lungs with prolonged exposure,\\\" says Lu. This is not a mixture you want in your home. Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar: A component of vinegar is acetic acid, and according to Lu, this acetic acid will form a chemical called peracetic acid when mixed with hydrogen peroxide . Peracetic acid is toxic and corrosive, meaning it can damage or break down the surface it's applied to. Bleach and Rubbing alcohol: R ubbing alcohol alone can be used for cleaning , but it can be dangerous, especially if mixed with bleach. Rubbing alcohol sold in pharmacies or conv\"\n}\n\n\nNow please analyze the web pages and provide all relevant information for the search query \"common household chemicals causing hazardous reactions when mixed\" and the search intent.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n",

The user is asking about the science behind explosive reactions and common substances that can cause hazardous reactions if misused, both in households and commercially. They also want to know how these materials are regulated and what precautions people should take.\n\nLooking at the previous thoughts, the user started by researching the science part, found info on exothermic reactions, oxidation, and examples like thermite. Then they moved to household chemicals, found mixtures like bleach and ammonia, and their dangers. Now they're looking into commercial substances. The last search query was about commercial chemicals prone to hazardous reactions when misused.\n\nSo the current search intent here is to identify commercial chemicals that have the potential for hazardous reactions if not handled properly. The user probably wants examples of such chemicals, maybe their uses, why they're dangerous, and perhaps how they can be misused. They might also be looking for specific cases or regulations related to these substances. Since the previous part covered household items, the commercial ones might include things like industrial chemicals, fertilizers, or materials used in manufacturing. \n\nThe user might need details on chemicals like ammonium nitrate (since that's mentioned in their thought), which is used in fertilizers but can be explosive. Other possibilities could be industrial cleaners, certain solvents, oxidizers, or reactive chemicals used in manufacturing processes. They might also want to know about regulations like OSHA standards, storage requirements, or safety protocols specific to these commercial substances. \n\nThe answer should list these chemicals, explain their potential hazards, maybe reference real-world incidents (like the Texas City disaster with ammonium nitrate), and discuss how they're regulated to prevent misuse. The user is likely compiling this information to understand both the science and practical safety aspects across different settings, so the response needs to be thorough but organized, perhaps with examples and regulatory measures.\n</think>\n\n**Current Search Intent:**  \nThe user is seeking information on **commercial chemicals or substances that pose significant explosion or hazardous reaction risks when mishandled**, including their properties, potential misuse scenarios, regulatory frameworks governing their use, and safety measures to mitigate risks.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Intent Breakdown:**  \n1. **Identification of Commercial Substances**:  \n   - The user aims to identify **industrial or commercial chemicals** (beyond household items) that can cause dangerous reactions if misused.

Chemical processes involved in using the chemical (mixing with other chemicals, purification, distillation, etc.). Other processes (improper storage, addition of moisture, storage in sunlight, refrigeration, etc.). The following sections describe general information and safety precautions about specific hazard classes. The chemical hazards listed are based on the Department of Transportation (DOT) hazard class system (which will be discussed in the Chemical Segregation section and where appropriate, will be noted as such). A listing of the DOT hazard classes can be found on the EHS Signs and Labels webpage . A general description of the hazards of various chemical functional groups can be found in the appendix. It is important to note that the following sections are general guidelines. Laboratory personnel should always review SDSs and other resources FIRST, before working with any chemical. OSHA Lab Standard Department of Transportation (DOT) hazard class system Safety in Academic Chemistry Laboratories Safety Data Sheets Webpage Cornell Health OSHA Definition of Health Hazard EHS Signs and Labels webpage Prudent Practices in the Laboratory EHS Online Training Programs Cornell Health 8.1 Explosives 8.1 Explosives The OSHA Laboratory Standard defines an explosive as a chemical that causes a sudden, almost instantaneous release of pressure, gas, and heat when subjected to sudden shock, pressure, or high temperature. Under the Department of Transportation (DOT) hazard class system, explosives are listed as hazard class 1. Fortunately, most laboratories do not use many explosives; however, there are a number of chemicals that can become unstable and/or potentially explosive over time due to contamination with air, water, other materials such as metals, or when the chemical dries out. If you ever come across any chemical that you suspect could be potentially shock sensitive and/or explosive, do not attempt to move the container as some of these compounds are shock, heat, and friction sensitive. In these instances, you should contact EHS at 607-255-8200 immediately. Explosives can result in damage to surrounding materials (hoods, glassware, windows, people, etc.), generation of toxic gases, and fires. If you plan to conduct an experiment where the potential for an explosion exists, first ask yourself the question; “Is there another chemical that could be substituted in the experiment that does not have an explosion potential?” If you must use a chemical that is potentially explosive, or for those compounds that you know are explosive, (even low powered explosives) you must first obtain prior approval from the Principal Investigator to use such chemicals. After obtaining prior approval from your Principal Investigator, thoroughly read the SDSs and any other chemical resources related to the potentially explosive compound(s) to ensure potential incidents are minimized. Whenever setting up experiments using potentially explosive compounds: Always use the smallest quantity of the chemical possible. Always conduct the experiment within a fume hood and use in conjunction with a properly rated safety shield. Be sure to remove any unnecessary equipment and other chemicals (particularly highly toxic and flammables) away from the immediate work area. Be sure to notify other people in the laboratory what experiment is being conducted, what the potential hazards are, and when the experiment will be run. Do not use metal or wooden devices when stirring, cutting, scraping, etc. with potentially explosive compounds. Non-sparking plastic devices should be used instead. Ensure other safety devices such as high temperature controls, water\"\n}\n***Web Page 4:***\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"1910.119 App A - List of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Toxics and Reactives (Mandatory) | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.119AppA\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.osha.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Appendix A to § 1910.119 - List of Highly <strong>Hazardous</strong> <strong>Chemicals</strong>, Toxics and Reactives (Mandatory) This appendix contains a listing of toxic and reactive highly <strong>hazardous</strong> <strong>chemicals</strong> which present a potential for a catastrophic event at or above the threshold quantity.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Vv0jSHS28xg2IBx_61KkNicz0lCjn_KyHxBnOqrOajA/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjI2ZGM2MjRj/YWEyZmYzODRjYjlj/NDFjMzIyNDNiODRi/NDFmMmUyYjI4ZmEw/MzhkYjk0Mjk4ZGM5/Y2U1NTFiOS93d3cu/b3NoYS5nb3Yv\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.osha.gov\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 5:***\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Chemical Hazards in Food: Examples & What Handlers Can Do to Prevent Contamination\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.fooddocs.com/post/chemical-hazards-in-food\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.fooddocs.com\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Are <strong>chemical</strong> <strong>hazards</strong> always visible in food?

Foods are made up of chemical compounds that make up their taste, color, smell, and nutritional quality. In the food industry, other chemical substances are added to food products to enhance or preserve their quality . All unnaturally present chemicals in food are required to be declared in the food labeling . Undeclared and unintentionally present substances can be considered chemical hazards in food . Key takeaways Chemical hazards in food can result from additives, preservatives, or natural occurrences, and may cause long-term health issues if not controlled. Proper food processing methods can eliminate naturally occurring chemical hazards, enhancing food safety. Misuse or excessive use of chemicals in food can turn otherwise safe additives into hazards. Food safety compliance requires all chemicals added to food to be declared on the label to avoid unintentional hazards. Environmental factors like water and soil can introduce chemical hazards into food, necessitating careful monitoring and control. Employee training is essential to manage chemical hazards effectively, particularly in understanding safe levels and proper handling practices. Chemical hazards vs. chemical contamination: Hazards are potential harmful substances, whereas contamination describes their actual entry into the food supply. Common chemical hazards in food include additives, environmental contaminants, and residues from cleaning agents. Preventive measures for managing chemical hazards include strict monitoring, using appropriate food handling procedures, and ensuring all food contact surfaces are free from contaminants. FoodDocs ' digital HACCP plan software helps in identifying and preventing chemical hazards in food production. Simple preservative materials, such as sugars, salts, and nitrites, are all considered chemical substances. What makes such materials hazardous for the consumer is when they are unintentionally added or present in excess. Chemical hazards can enter the food system at any point in the cycle. They can be naturally absorbed by foods when being grown, or introduced because of poor food handling. Food handlers must know what are chemical hazards to understand how to control their presence and reduce any concern for chemical exposure. Learn to identify which chemicals can be considered a chemical hazard in the food industry with this article. Read through our content and find out some of the most common chemical hazards in food and the most efficient digital solution to prevent food safety hazards from contaminating your products. WHAT WE'LL COVER: Definition of a chemical hazard What is a chemical hazard in food? Examples of chemical hazards in food Where are chemical hazards commonly found? What should food handlers do if a chemical hazard is detected? What can chemical hazards in food cause? What should a food worker do to prevent a chemical hazard from making food unsafe to eat? How can I automatically analyze chemical hazards and their criticality? How can I help my team in preventing chemical hazards? FAQs Definition of a chemical hazard Chemical hazards definition refers to chemical substances that are unintentionally present in foods . They can also be naturally present in foods but are at harmful levels for human consumption. When consumed, chemical hazards can cause adverse health effects to humans. The results can range from acute to chronic illnesses, depending on the type and amount of chemical hazards in foods. Food handlers are responsible for reducing the customer's risk to chemical exposure. What is a chemical hazard in food? In the food industry, chemicals are always used. Chemicals don't always have negative effects on humans. Some substances only become harmful when misused, mishandled, or added in excessive amounts against food safety standards. A chemical hazard in food is any substance with a chemical nature that can harm the consumers. A wide range of chemical hazards is present in the food industry. Workplace chemical hazards can be equipment lubricants, additives, chemical toxins, veterinary medicinal products, by-products of animals, and agricultural chemicals or plant protection products (e.g., pesticides). In some cases, chemical hazards are produced by biological materials, such as the food itself, as a defence mechanism. Hazardous chemicals in food are also sometimes used as an indicator of overprocessing of foods. By-product chemical substances, such as acrylamide, can form when products high in sugar and proteins are heated excessively. This type of hazard in food can cause long-term effects on consumers, as compared to foodborne illnesses caused by biological hazards. Some chemical hazards can lead to birth defects, cancers, or severe sensitivity to chemicals. Chemical hazard vs chemical contamination Chemical hazards are defined as any substance that can enter the food supply chain and cause negative effects on consumers. Different types of chemicals can be considered hazardous. On the other hand, chemical contamination is the event wherein a chemical hazard enters the food supply chain . During food handling, if an employee accidentally adds an unknown food additive to the food, that occurrence is called chemical contamination. In this case, an example of a chemical hazard is the unknown additive. Direct contact with harmful chemical hazards can have negative effects on food handlers. What is an example of a chemical food hazard? Every food business is open to chemical hazard contamination. There is a wide variety of chemical hazards. The cleaning agents, machine oils, and hand sanitizers in your kitchen can become a chemical hazard when improperly handled. The Codex Alimentarius has identified a hazardous chemical list and provided food safety guidelines and standards for at least 250 food additives and 250 agricultural chemicals. This list of food additives and chemicals acts as a comprehensive guide for food handlers. Chemical hazard examples in food products can be any of the following categories: Food additives and preservatives . Used for improving the quality and shelf-life of products but can become a health hazard in high levels Agricultural chemicals . Residues of substances used for growing crops and vegetables, such as pesticides and fertilizers Chemicals from overprocessing or temperature abuse (e.g., acrylamide and furans) Environmental contaminants . Includes heavy metals found in soil and water Natural toxins from microorganisms and animals (e.g., marine toxins) Antinutritional chemicals that are naturally present in foods (e.g., glycoalkaloids in potatoes, which are toxic to humans in high amounts Cleaning agents and industrial chemicals in a kitchen Corrosive chemicals Hand sanitizers and soaps Processing chemicals used for machines Intentionally added chemical residues in food as a form of terrorism or economic attack This chemical hazard list is non\"\n}\n***Web Page 6:***\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"Definition of hazardous chemical and OSHA's MSDS requirement for determining applicability of EPCRA 311/312 | US EPA\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.epa.gov/epcra/definition-hazardous-chemical-and-oshas-msds-requirement-determining-applicability-epcra\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.epa.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The requirements of 40 CFR Part 370, promulgated pursuant to EPCRA Sections 311 and 312, apply to facilities that have certain quantities of <strong>hazardous</strong> <strong>chemicals</strong> for which they are required, under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), to prepare or\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/e9Xpm2vO4IcnPqyUHBJUfTmrWbSITIDSaIZQWYnhLCo/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMmI4MTBhNjQx/MDQ5ZDFlNmJhZWZi/Y2NlMjNkNzEzODYy/MjY1ZmQ2OTc0NjMy/OWFhZTBjYmU2ZmUw/ZTMxYWY1YS93d3cu/ZXBhLmdvdi8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.epa.gov\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Definition of hazardous chemical and OSHA's MSDS requirement for determining applicability of EPCRA 311/312 | US EPA Skip to main content An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.

How should a facility determine whether it must comply with 40 CFR Part 370 if it is uncertain whether it has a hazardous chemical for which OSHA requires an MSDS? There is no comprehensive list of hazardous chemicals. The EPCRA regulations in 40 CFR Part 370 cite OSHA's broad definition of hazardous chemical (with certain exceptions listed in EPCRA Section 311(e)), which includes any element, compound, or mixture of elements that is a physical hazard or a health hazard ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) and 40 CFR Section 370.2 ). Health hazards include, among others, chemicals that are carcinogens, toxics, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosive, neurotoxins, hepatotoxins, and chemicals that damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes (29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) and Appendix A). Physical hazards include, among others, chemicals that are combustible, explosive, flammable, oxidizers, reactive, unstable, water-reactive, as well as compressed gases ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) ). OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200 ) requires chemical manufacturers and importers to obtain or develop an MSDS for each hazardous chemical that they produce or import, and requires employers to have an MSDS available for each hazardous chemical that they use ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(g) ). OSHA regulations list several exemptions to the Hazard Communication Standard in 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(b)(6) . OSHA provides the following guidance regarding which chemicals are covered by the Hazard Communication Standard: The Hazard Communication Standard applies to any chemical with an OSHA permissible exposure level, anything listed with a threshold limit value by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, any carcinogen listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Groups 1, 2A, and 2B), any carcinogen listed by the National Toxicology Program, or any chemical regulated by OSHA as a carcinogen.

Resources / Knowledge Centre / Blog / Chemical Health Hazards: How Hazardous Chemicals Can Damage the Health of your Workers Chemical Health Hazards: How Hazardous Chemicals Can Damage the Health of your Workers Originally Published July 13, 2023 1:29:37 AM , Updated July 13, 2023 Substances that create a risk to the health and safety of humans, other organisms and the environment are recognised as ‘hazardous chemicals’. These substances require careful management in the workplace, as they possess both physical hazards (eg, flammable, corrosive, chemically-reactive) and chemical hazards (eg, toxic, carcinogenic). This post identifies the common chemical health hazards that could affect your staff. We also highlight how the toxicology of the hazardous chemical in your workplace may combine with other factors to create an immediate health affect. These chemical side effects could range from nausea, vomiting, chemical burns or poisoning, to a long-term disease or ailment, like dermatitis, lung damage or even cancer. IMPORTANT: Hazardous chemicals are not just liquids; they may also be solids or gases and when used in the workplace could contaminate workers via fumes, vapours, dusts, smoke and mists. Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals There are countless hazardous chemicals in the home and the workplace, all with specific hazards to human health. Harmful substances, such as pesticides , glues, disinfectants and caustic chemicals, can cause damage to humans (as well as other living creatures) through the routes of exposure. So, how do hazardous substances enter the body? In the next section, we’ll detail the routes of exposure and how these substances can cause harm. Hazardous chemicals can affect human health through the routes of exposure. Routes of Exposure Without the correct personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation and general working conditions, hazardous chemicals can harm the people in your organisation. Hazardous chemicals can enter the body of your workers in a three ways: 1. Direct Contact With The Eyes Or Skin One of the most obvious ways hazardous chemicals enter the body is by direct contact to the eyes or skin. Very often the reaction is quick and painful: the skin becomes red, swollen, blistered, or itchy while the eyes can immediately be rendered blind. 2. Inhaling (Breathing In) Hazardous Chemicals Workers can inhale compressed gases, toxic smoke and mist, or the vapours and fumes from flammable liquids and poisons. Once inhaled, the chemicals move into the bloodstream. They can penetrate major organs like the lungs, liver and kidneys. Inhalation can also affect the reproductive and nervous systems of those exposed to hazardous chemicals. 3. Ingesting (Swallowing) Hazardous Substances Many workers have died or suffered terrible injuries from ingesting or swallowing hazardous chemicals. Though it may seem unlikely an adult would knowingly swallow hazardous chemicals, it can happen accidentally.

The old saying, \\\"what you don't know can't hurt you,\\\" isn't always good advice. When it comes to toxic substances, WHAT YOU KNOW CAN HELP YOU. Radon in basements, lead in drinking water, exhausts from cars and chemicals released from landfills are just a few examples of toxic substances that can hurt you. By understanding how, you can reduce your exposure to chemicals and reduce your risk of harmful health effects. What is a toxic substance? A toxic substance is a substance that can be poisonous or cause health effects. People are generally concerned about chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin which can be found at some hazardous waste sites. Products that we use daily, such as household cleaners, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, gasoline, alcohol, pesticides, fuel oil and cosmetics, can also be toxic. Any chemical can be toxic or harmful under certain conditions. Health effects: toxic or hazardous? Chemicals can be toxic because they can harm us when they enter or contact the body. Exposure to a toxic substance such as gasoline can affect your health. Since drinking gasoline can cause burns, vomiting, diarrhea and, in very large amounts, drowsiness or death, it is toxic. Some chemicals are hazardous because of their physical properties: they can explode, burn or react easily with other chemicals. Since gasoline can burn and its vapors can explode, gasoline is also hazardous. A chemical can be toxic, or hazardous, or both. How can toxic substances cause harm? Since chemicals can be toxic, it is important to understand how they can affect health. To determine the risk of harmful health effects from a substance, you must first know how toxic the substance is; how much, and by what means, a person is exposed; and how sensitive that person is to the substance. Toxicity Some substances are more toxic than others. The toxicity of a substance is described by the types of effects it causes and its potency. Types of Effects: Different chemicals cause different effects. For example, Chemical A may cause vomiting, but not cancer. Chemical B may have no noticeable effects during exposure, but may cause cancer years later. Potency: Potency (strength) is a measure of a chemical's toxicity. A more potent chemical is more toxic. For example, sodium cyanide is more potent than sodium chloride (table salt) since swallowing a smaller amount of cyanide can poison you. The potency and, therefore, the toxicity of a chemical can be affected by its breakdown within the human body. When a substance is absorbed into the body, its chemical structure may be changed or metabolized to a substance that is more toxic or less t\"\n}\n***Web Page 11:***\n{\n  \"id\": 11,\n  \"title\": \"What are Chemical Hazards?

Hazard recognition also reduces the chance of exposure to hazardous chemicals and the injuries they can bring. Types of Chemical Hazards Although there are several types of chemical hazards that have been generally identified, the following are the chemicals commonly found in the workplace : Health hazard – This symbol shows a person with damage and pertains to chemicals that can cause serious and long-term negative impacts on health. Carcinogens are also substances that are known to be cancer-causing chemicals. They are categorized as either natural or manmade, but it is crucial to note that even a small amount of this type of chemical can severely damage human health. Flammable – The symbol for this is a flame and it pertains to chemicals or highly flammable gases that may catch fire or ignite once exposed to air or other ignition sources or elements. Irritant/hazardous/hazardous to the ozone layer – This is symbolized by a big exclamation point and refers to chemicals that usually cause redness, rashes, or inflammation of the affected area. Although the presence of symptoms is normally short-term, there are still instances where they create long-lasting effects on others. It is also known to either cause harm to individuals or pose a threat to public health by harming the ozone layer. Gas under pressure – The symbol for this is a gas cylinder and it pertains to gases that are stored under pressure and may explode if heated or refrigerated gases that may cause burns or injury. Corrosion – This pictogram shows corrosion of material and skin. It refers to chemicals that can cause severe skin burns and damage to the tissue once contacted with. Explosives – This is symbolized by an exploding bomb and pertains to chemicals that may explode or can cause a mass explosion. Oxidizers – This pictogram shows a flame over a circle and symbolizes chemicals or substances that, under certain conditions or exposure to other chemicals or elements, can cause severe physical hazards such as fires or explosions. Hazardous to the environment – The symbol for this is a dead tree and fish. It refers to chemicals that can cause lasting damage to the environment. Toxic – This pictogram shows a skull and crossbones, and symbolizes chemicals that even at a very low exposure—can cause irreversible changes or mutations to a person’s DNA, damage to health, or even fatality. Chemical Hazards Examples Exposure to hazardous chemicals in workplaces can result in adverse health conditions including headaches, difficulty breathing, skin irritation, severe allergic reactions, and other more serious and long-lasting side effects. Although most hazardous chemicals are easily identifiable, some of them may be used on a daily basis with workers not having prior knowledge of their potential negative effects. Examples of hazardous chemicals in the workplace include: Gasoline – Inhalation or skin contact can lead to dizziness, headaches, and in severe cases, respiratory and central nervous system depression. Methanol – This is toxic if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and, in severe cases, damage to the optic nerve, leading to blindness. Disinfectants – Exposure to and skin contact with disinfectants can cause respiratory irritation, skin allergies, and, in some cases, more severe reactions. Some disinfectants may also release harmful fumes. Glues – Skin contact may result in irritation or allergic reactions. Cleaning materials – Some cleaning agents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can contribute to indoor air pollution. Detergents – Prolonged exposure to detergents may lead to dermatitis while ingestion can cause gastrointestinal irritation. Pesticides – Can cause various health risks, including skin and eye irritation, respiratory issues, and sometimes, even neurological damage. Paints – Aside from health risks, it can also contribute to air pollution. Cosmetics – Certain cosmetics may also contain harmful substances if ingeste\"\n}\n***Web Page 12:***\n{\n  \"id\": 12,\n  \"title\": \"Types of hazardous chemicals | Business Queensland\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/whs/hazardous-chemicals/types\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.business.qld.gov.au\",\n  \"snippet\": \"What <strong>hazardous</strong> <strong>chemicals</strong> are commonly found in the workplace?\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xCsDJ1e0NHStt97idO7cSTirqdSgeNq_6bsNyee11-Y/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMTA4ZjZjMTgw/YTVjZTY1MTE5NjJk/ZmE0MmRlNDdkNmRl/YWQ1MDEwNDgxYWM3/ZGNiMmIxMTRlZTk3/ODg0NzRhZS93d3cu/YnVzaW5lc3MucWxk/Lmdvdi5hdS8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.business.qld.gov.au\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \" Managing hazardous chemicals in the workplace Types of hazardous chemicals Workplace health and safety Business health and safety resources for coronavirus (COVID-19) Keeping your workplace safe Mental health and wellbeing resources for businesses Domestic and family violence resources for businesses Work related violence Incident reporting to Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (WHSQ) Work health and safety licences in Queensland Work health and safety laws in Queensland Plant registration with Workplace Health and Safety Queensland Managing hazardous chemicals in the workplace Types of hazardous chemicals How to identify hazardous chemicals Assess the risks of hazardous chemicals Control the risks for hazardous chemicals Prevent emergencies caused by hazardous chemicals Storing and transporting hazardous chemicals Electrical safety Gas safety Recreational side-by-side vehicles on private property Types of hazardous chemicals A variety of hazardous chemicals are commonly found in the workplace.

Use a key-filler or other closed-system device when filling anesthesia vaporizers. This minimizes exposure to halogenated anesthetics from spills and vaporization. Provide employees initial and annual refresher training on anesthetic gas hazards and ways to minimize exposure. Ensure employees can easily find the anesthetic gas safe handling procedures. Antineoplastic drugs Antineoplastic drugs treat cancer, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other non-cancer medical conditions. Chemotherapy, cytotoxic, and oncology drugs are also antineoplastic drugs. NIOSH classifies most antineoplastic drugs as hazardous . Many are carcinogens with no safe level of exposure. Examples of workers who are at risk include: Pharmacists. Veterinarians. Veterinary technicians. Custodial workers. Nurses. Nursing aids. Job tasks at most risk include: Preparing and administering these drugs. Shipping and receiving these drugs. Laundering linens and towels. Handling patient bodily waste (including animal patients). Cleaning areas where drugs have been handled. Healthcare workers exposed to chemotherapy drugs have increased risk of: Leukemia. Other cancers. Adverse reproductive outcomes. Chromosomal damage. How employers and employees can reduce exposure Avoid skin contact with liquid antineoplastic drugs. During administration or compounding activities, always wear chemotherapy gloves and a nonabsorbent gown with a closed front and tight-fitting cuffs. When administering, prime IV tubing with a non-hazardous drug containing liquid. Use supplementary engineering controls to reduce likelihood of exposure to liquid or aerosolized antineoplastic drugs. Closed system drug-transfer devices and needleless systems are two examples of engineering controls. When preparing antineoplastic drugs use a biological safety cabinet. Provide training to employees on the hazards of antineoplastic drugs and safe handling precautions to minimize exposure. Provide information and training at the time of initial job assignment and annually. Provide medical surveillance for employees exposed to hazardous drugs and encourage them to participate. Chemical sterilants Chemical sterilants treat surgical instruments and medical supplies so that patients are not exposed to pathogens. Though chemical sterilants are important for patient care, they can be hazardous to healthcare workers. Common chemical sterilants used in healthcare include: Ethylene oxide (EtO) . Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP). Vaporized hydrogen peroxide. Immersion and vapor phase peracetic acid (PAA). Acute exposure to EtO can cause: Respiratory irritation. Headache. Nausea. Shortness of breath. Chronic exposure to EtO can cause: Cancer. Reproductive effects. Mutagenic changes. Neurotoxicity. Sensitization. Acute exposure to HPGP and PAA may cause: Upper respiratory tract irritation. Skin irritation when there is contact with liquid solutions. How employers and employees can reduce exposure Train employees on the hazards of EtO, HPGP, and PAA prior to working with these and other sterilants. Ensure employees have access to standard operating procedures for the safe use of these sterilants. Hospital employers need to use a single chamber sterilization process for EtO. For example, the sterilization and aeration take place in one unit. EPA prohibited the use of separate units in March 2010. This was done to eliminate EtO exposure while transferring the load from the sterilizer to the aerator. High-level disinfectants High-level disinfectants (HLDs) chemically disinfect reusable medical and dental devices. HLDs prevent healthcare-associated infections among patients. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared HLDs contain one or more of these ingredients (this is not a full list): Glutaraldehyde Ortho-Phthaldehyde Peracetic acid Hydrogen peroxide Hypochlorous acid Hypochlorite Acute health effects of exposure to HLDs include: Dermatitis.

With worker safety and environmental laws continually evolving at the state and federal levels, it’s more important than ever to avoid these 10 common pitfalls to ensure your employees, community and business are safe: Incorrect dilution Mixing incompatible materials Ignoring Safety Data Sheets (SDS) Improper storage Using the wrong chemical for the job Inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) Overlooking ventilation requirements Failing to train employees properly Neglecting to label containers Improper disposal of chemicals Incorrect Dilution One of the most frequent mistakes in using industrial cleaning chemicals is incorrect dilution. Many employees may assume that using a higher concentration will increase the chemical’s effectiveness, leading to quicker or better cleaning results. On the other hand, diluting a chemical too much to save costs can render it ineffective. Both approaches are problematic. Over-concentrated solutions can be hazardous, potentially causing damage to surfaces or releasing toxic fumes, while under-concentrated solutions may not properly clean, leaving contaminants behind. How to Do It Right: Always follow the manufacturer's recommended dilution ratios. These guidelines are carefully calculated to ensure the chemical works effectively while minimizing risks. Use precise measuring tools and mix chemicals in designated areas to avoid contamination. Training employees on the importance of correct dilution can help prevent accidents and ensure consistent cleaning performance. Mixing Incompatible Chemicals A common but dangerous mistake is mixing incompatible chemicals, either intentionally or accidentally. Some workers might believe that combining different cleaning agents will create a more powerful solution. However, this can lead to harmful chemical reactions, such as the release of toxic gasses like chlorine when bleach is mixed with ammonia, or even explosions in extreme cases.

Some common laboratory chemicals can also form potentially explosive peroxides over time, even when stored in sealed containers. Manufacturers sometimes add inhibitors to these compounds to retard peroxide formation. Chloroform can form very toxic phosgene over time when exposed to oxygen and amounts of UV light (or if contaminants are present). Unstabilized chloroform should be discarded 6 months after opening and stabilized chloroform discarded after 12 months. Peroxide-forming chemicals should be purchased in amber bottles and stored under dark conditions. In general, the preferred method for safe management of these chemicals is to purchase them in the smallest quantity needed, date label their containers, and discard them as hazardous waste before the manufacturer’s expiration date. Class A compounds should be disposed of within 3 months of receipt. Class B compounds should be disposed of within 6 months of receipt. Class C compounds (and Class B with stabilizers) can generally be stored for longer periods of time but should be visually i nspected at least every 6 months. The table below describes the three generally recognized classes of peroxide-forming chemicals and provides some common laboratory examples of each. Additional information on peroxide-forming chemicals is available from Safety Data Sheets, technical references and EHS. Class A Chemicals that form explosive levels of peroxides without  concentration: Butadiene Chloroprene Isopropyl ether Potassium amide Sodium amide Class B Chemicals that form explosive levels of peroxides upon distillation or evaporation: Cumene Cyclohexene Diethyl ether Dioxane Furan Tetrahydrofuran Class C Unsaturated monomers that can auto-polymerize if inhibitors have been removed or depleted: Acrylic acid Butadiene Ethyl acrylate Methyl methacrylate Styrene Vinyl acetate Perchloric acid, picric acid, and sodium azide are three additional chemicals that can pose serious explosion hazards. These three chemicals pose little risk of explosive reaction when kept wet by solution in water. When dried, however, their residues (as perchlorates, picrates, and azides) can become shock, friction, and heat sensitive, and frequently accumulate under bottle caps over time. Controlled Substances are drugs, drug-like substances, and certain precursor materials that are regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy (VBP). Researchers planning work with controlled substances must first obtain Practitioner registrations from both the DEA and VBP, and meet specific laboratory security, inventory control, and user authorization requirements. Current lists of controlled substances and registration requirements are available from the DEA and VBP websites. Chemicals of Interest - Department of Homeland Security - Several hundred chemicals are regulated under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards (CFATS). DHS has established screening threshold quantity limits for each of the chemicals of interest under different accident or terrorist scenarios. Chemicals of interest must be kept secure from unauthorized access. Copies of the current list of DHS chemicals of interest can be obtained from the CFATS website or by contacting EHS.

If you aren’t sure whether a chemical is hazardous, check information on required safety data sheets (SDSs) and product labels. Request a current SDS and label from distributors or manufacturers if you don't have them. Chemicals in the air Check to see if chemicals can be released into the air as vapor, liquid or solid particles, or as a gas during work activities (e.g., spraying, sanding, welding), processes (e.g., combustion, evaporation, fermentation), or from equipment (e.g., metal plating tanks, industrial mixers and conveyors). Chemicals in the air that are possibly hazardous are called “airborne contaminants” and regulated under the Air Contaminants rule, Chapter 296-841 WAC . Airborne contaminants would necessitate additional safety measures when workers’ exposures are above the regulated limit for the chemical (called a permissible exposure limit or PEL). Depending on the chemical, you may be required to: Conduct exposure monitoring of workers' exposures. Improve ventilation and safe work procedures and practices. Use respirators and other special PPE. Provide for medical monitoring. Prepare for emergency spills and other releases. Provide for worker and supervisor training about specific hazards, safe work procedures and practices, PPE use, housekeeping, and other prevention measures relating to chemical safety. Exposure Limits (PELs) for Airborne Contaminants Of the thousands of chemicals used in workplaces, only a few hundred have Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) . PELs are regulated limits set to protect most workers from potential harm. Air testing or sampling is often the best way to evaluate whether workers exposures are too high. This is also called “exposure monitoring”.  Exposure monitoring is a complex task and requires specialized knowledge, equipment, and experience to ensure proper protocols are followed and results are accurate. Industrial hygienists or other specialized safety professionals, such as an L&I consultant , can help.

Program Requirements Creating a Hazard Communication Program At a minimum, employers are required to develop and follow a written Chemical Hazard Communication Program when employees work with or around hazardous chemicals. Employers who import, manufacture, or distribute hazardous chemicals have additional responsibilities. If you aren’t sure whether a chemical is hazardous, check information on required safety data sheets (SDSs) and product labels. Request a current SDSs and labels from distributors or manufacturers if you don't have one and be sure to keep a list of the hazardous chemicals currently present in your company’s workplace. Rule requirements are outlined in the Hazard Communication Standard, WAC 296-901-140 . A sample, customizable hazard communication program template is available in English and Spanish: Chemical Hazard Communication Program Chemical Hazard Communication Program (Spanish) The Employer’s Guide to the Hazard Communication Rule provides a helpful checklist, answers to common questions about requirements, training guidance and a standardized label and pictograms to help your company comply with the rule. This guide is also available in Spanish.

They started with a question about the science behind explosive reactions, common household and commercial substances that can be hazardous if misused, how these are regulated, and safety precautions. \n\nLooking at their previous searches, they first looked into the science part, then moved to household chemicals, then commercial ones, and now they're querying about regulations involving OSHA and EPA. The last search query was \"regulations for hazardous chemicals OSHA EPA\". \n\nSo, the user is probably compiling information for a comprehensive answer to their original question. They've covered the science, examples of substances, and now they need details on regulations and safety measures. The next step after regulations would be the precautions, but maybe they want to ensure they cover all regulatory aspects first.\n\nThe user might be a student working on a research paper, or someone involved in safety protocols, maybe a professional needing to understand compliance. They want to know which agencies are involved (OSHA, EPA), specific regulations like hazard communication standards, storage requirements, maybe things like the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for EPA, or OSHA's HAZWOPER standards. They might also be interested in how these regulations prevent misuse and ensure public safety.\n\nThey might also be looking for how these regulations translate into everyday precautions, like labeling, training, PPE requirements, or emergency protocols. Since the original question asked about both household and commercial substances, the regulations might differ between consumer products and industrial use. The user might need to distinguish between the two in their answer.\n\nI should make sure the intent captures the need for specific regulatory frameworks from OSHA and EPA, how they govern the handling, storage, and use of hazardous chemicals, and perhaps international regulations if relevant. Also, mentioning enforcement mechanisms or penalties could be part of it. The user wants to ensure their answer covers the regulatory side thoroughly to address the original question's part about public safety measures.\n</think>\n\n**Current Search Intent:**  \nThe user is seeking detailed information on **regulatory frameworks** (specifically from OSHA and EPA) that govern the handling, storage, and use of hazardous chemicals to ensure public safety. They aim to understand:  \n\n1. **Key Regulations**:  \n   - OSHA standards (e.g., Hazard Communication Standard [HazCom], HAZWOPER, PPE requirements).  \n   - EPA regulations (e.g., TSCA, RCRA, Clean Air Act) for chemical management and disposal.  \n   - International standards (e.g., GHS labeling) if applicable.  \n\n2. **Enforcement Mechanisms**:  \n   - How agencies monitor compliance (inspections, reporting).  \n   - Penalties for non-compliance (fines, legal action).  \n\n3. **Public Safety Measures**:  \n   - Mandatory labeling, SDS (Safety Data Sheets), and worker training.  \n   - Storage requirements (segregation of incompatible substances, ventilation).  \n   - Emergency response protocols (spill management, evacuation plans).  \n\n4. **Distinction Between Household vs. Commercial Regulations**:  \n   - Consumer product safety (e.g., CPSC, poison control warnings).  \n   - Industrial regulations for workplaces and manufacturing.  \n\n5. **Examples of Regulatory Impact**:  \n   - Case studies (e.g., Beirut explosion linked to ammonium nitrate mismanagement).  \n   - How regulations prevent accidents like chemical fires or toxic releases.  \n\n**Underlying Goal**:  \nTo complete the original question by providing a structured analysis of how governments and agencies mitigate risks from hazardous substances, ensuring the answer addresses both **regulatory structures** and **practical precautions** for individuals and organizations.\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**\n***Web Page 1:***\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Definition of hazardous chemical and OSHA's MSDS requirement for determining applicability of EPCRA 311/312 | US EPA\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.epa.gov/epcra/definition-hazardous-chemical-and-oshas-msds-requirement-determining-applicability-epcra\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.epa.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"How should a facility determine whether it must comply with <strong>40 CFR Part 370</strong> if it is uncertain whether it has a hazardous chemical for which OSHA requires an MSDS?

How should a facility determine whether it must comply with 40 CFR Part 370 if it is uncertain whether it has a hazardous chemical for which OSHA requires an MSDS? There is no comprehensive list of hazardous chemicals. The EPCRA regulations in 40 CFR Part 370 cite OSHA's broad definition of hazardous chemical (with certain exceptions listed in EPCRA Section 311(e)), which includes any element, compound, or mixture of elements that is a physical hazard or a health hazard ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) and 40 CFR Section 370.2 ). Health hazards include, among others, chemicals that are carcinogens, toxics, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosive, neurotoxins, hepatotoxins, and chemicals that damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes (29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) and Appendix A). Physical hazards include, among others, chemicals that are combustible, explosive, flammable, oxidizers, reactive, unstable, water-reactive, as well as compressed gases ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) ). OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200 ) requires chemical manufacturers and importers to obtain or develop an MSDS for each hazardous chemical that they produce or import, and requires employers to have an MSDS available for each hazardous chemical that they use ( 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(g) ). OSHA regulations list several exemptions to the Hazard Communication Standard in 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(b)(6) . OSHA provides the following guidance regarding which chemicals are covered by the Hazard Communication Standard: The Hazard Communication Standard applies to any chemical with an OSHA permissible exposure level, anything listed with a threshold limit value by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, any carcinogen listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Groups 1, 2A, and 2B), any carcinogen listed by the National Toxicology Program, or any chemical regulated by OSHA as a carcinogen. In addition to these chemicals, the Hazard Communication Standard applies to any substance for which there is statistically significant evidence, based on at least one positive study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles, that indicates a health hazard as defined in 29 CFR Section 1910.1200(c) . One option for facility owners or operators who are not certain whether they have a hazardous chemical that requires an MSDS under OSHA is to contact the manufacturer of the substance for assistance in making this determination. The manufacturer (or importer) of a particular chemical substance has the primary responsibility under OSHA for determining whether that chemical is subject to OSHA's MSDS requirements. OSHA regulations require manufacturers and importers to provide information on the hazard of their chemicals to persons using or distributing those chemicals. A second option for such owners or operators is to assume that an MSDS is required, and to determine whether the requirements in 40 CFR Part 370 apply, based on whether or not the substance was present at the facility in a threshold amount or more. Facility owners or operators who require additional assistance in determining whether or not they are subject to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (i.e., the MSDS requirements) may contact the appropriate local area OSHA office.

However, the steps necessary to keep workers safe will vary, depending on the situation, and especially depending on the chemical in question. To address this, OSHA's rules for workplace safety include a variety of regulations addressing hazardous materials. Some key regulations apply to nearly all workplaces and situations. For some specific chemicals and circumstances, OSHA applies additional requirements. These chemical regulations are found in OSHA's rules for general industry, in 29 CFR part 1910; specifically, in subpart H (Hazardous Materials, 1910.101 to 1910.126) and subpart Z (Toxic and Hazardous Substances, 1910.1000 to 1910.1450). What is a Hazardous Chemical? Some regulations, such as those from the Department of Transportation (DOT) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), use strict or specific definitions to identify what counts as a \\\"hazardous chemical.\\\" When discussing workplace safety and OSHA regulations, however, there are broader definitions. For these cases, a \\\"hazardous chemical\\\" is any chemical or mixture that presents a potential source of personal harm or property damage, as a result of its chemical properties . Under OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard, or HazCom 2012 , this is the technical definition provided: Hazardous chemical means any chemical which is classified as a physical hazard or a health hazard, a simple asphyxiant, combustible dust, pyrophoric gas, or hazard not otherwise classified. -29 CFR 1910.1200(c) In this definition, the terms \\\"physical hazard\\\" and \\\"health hazard\\\" cover the two main categories of chemical hazards derived from the Globally Harmonized System, or GHS. This system is an international standard for discussing issues of chemical safety, and OSHA has adapted it for use in the United States. Physical hazards include flammable materials, corrosive materials, and other physical dangers; health hazards include respiratory irritants, carcinogens, and other biological dangers. The other types of hazards listed in the OSHA definition of \\\"hazardous chemical\\\" are discussed in detail later in the HazCom 2012 regulation. \\\"Hazard not otherwise classified,\\\" or HNOC, is a catch-all category for hazards that haven't been described in the regulation, but are still recognized as hazards. Key Chemical Safety Regulations Some of the most important rules in subparts H and Z apply to a variety of industries, applications, and materials. Even when none of the other chemical regulations from OSHA apply, it's important to understand and follow these requirements. 1910.119 - Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals. These rules apply to business processes where specific chemicals (from a list of over 100 materials) are present in specified quantities. This regulation specifically calls for a \\\"process hazard analysis,\\\" which is similar to a Chemical Risk Assessment , but goes into more detail, and considers the kinds of failures or accidents that might make a work process more dangerous than normal. A process hazard analysis must be updated at least once every five years. 1910.120 - Hazardous waste operations and emergency response. These rules, also referred to as HAZWOPER, cover safety requirements for dealing with spills, leaks, and other unintended releases of hazardous chemicals, as well as dealing with hazardous wastes that are produced as part of an ordinary business process. Regulations from the EPA may also be relevant for these issues. 1910.1000 - Air contaminants. This regulation applies to a long list of materials that can be suspended or mixed into the air; the list includes identification of the specific chemicals that must be considered, along with the concentration of each chemical that will trigger the requirements in the rule. Some specific air contaminants, such as silica dust, have their own additional rules elsewhere. 1910.1020 - Employee exposure and medical records. Many chemicals have important health effects that result from repeated or long-term exposure. Scientific studies continue to find new effects caused by existing materials, as well. To provide a way to protect employees in the future, companies that deal with hazardous chemicals have an obligation to keep records of exposures, accidents, and medical tests. 1910.1030 - Bloodborne pathogens. While blood and other potentially infectious materials are not usually thought of as \\\"chemicals,\\\" they are materials that can pose a distinct hazard to employee health.

Facilities must submit the safety data sheet (SDS) or a list of hazardous chemicals to their State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and local fire department. Facilities must also submit an annual inventory of these chemicals by March 1 of each year to their State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and local fire department. The information submitted by facilities must be made available to the public. What facilities are covered? What is a hazardous chemical? What are facilities required to do? How do I submit a Tier I or Tier II Inventory Report? Where can I find more information on these requirements? What facilities are covered? Any facility that is required to maintain SDSs under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations for hazardous chemicals stored or used in the workplace. Facilities with chemicals in quantities that equal or exceed the following thresholds must report: For Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHSs) (40 CFR part 355 Appendix A and Appendix B ), either 500 pounds or the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ), whichever is lower. For gasoline (all grades combined) at a retail gas station, the threshold level is 75,000 gallons (or approximately 283,900 liters), if the tank(s) was stored entirely underground and was in compliance at all times during the preceding calendar year with all applicable Underground Storage Tank (UST) requirements at 40 CFR part 280 or requirements of the State UST program approved by the Agency under 40 CFR part 281. For diesel fuel (all grades combined) at a retail gas station, the threshold level is 100,000 gallons (or approximately 378,500 liters), if the tank(s) was stored entirely underground and the tank(s) was in compliance at all times during the preceding calendar year with all applicable UST requirements at 40 CFR part 280 or requirements of the State UST program approved by the Agency under 40 CFR part 281. For all other hazardous chemicals: 10,000 pounds. What is a hazardous chemical? Hazardous chemicals are substances for which a facility must maintain a SDS under the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard , which lists the criteria used to identify a hazardous chemical. SDSs are detailed information sheets that provide data on health hazards and physical hazards of chemicals along with associated protective measures. Over 500,000 products have SDSs which are normally obtained from the chemical manufacturer. What are facilities required to do? Under Section 311 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), facilities must submit the SDSs of hazardous chemicals present on-site at or above the reporting threshold to their State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and local fire department. Facilities may choose to submit a list of the hazardous chemicals grouped into hazard categories instead. This is a one-time submittal. New facilities have three months after becoming subject to the OSHA regulations to submit their SDSs or the list of the hazardous chemicals to their State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and the fire department. Facilities that need to submit SDSs or the list of hazardous chemicals under Section 311, also need to submit an annual inventory report for the same chemicals ( EPCRA Section 312). This inventory report must be submitted to the State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and the local fire department by March 1 of each year. Please check with your state, tribe, or territory for any additional reporting requirements. How do I submit a Tier I or Tier II Inventory Report? Facilities covered by these requirements must submit an emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form to their State or Tribal Emergency Response Commission (SERC or TERC), Local or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or TEPC), and the local fire department annually. Facilities provide either a Tier I or Tier II form. Most States require the Tier II form. Tier II forms require basic facility identification information, employee contact information for both emergencies and non-emergencies, information about chemicals stored or used at the facility, and additional data elements which would be useful to local planners and responders. The following is a list of some of the information required on the inventory form: The chemical name or the common name as indicated on the SDS An estimate of the maximum amount of the chemical present at any time during the preceding calendar year and the average daily amount A brief description of the manner of storage of the chemical The location of the chemical at the facility An indication of whether the owner of the facility elects to withhold location information from disclosure to the public Tier I Forms and Instructions Tier II Forms and Instructions Tier II Reporting Requirements by State and Tier2 Submit Software Where can I find more information on these requirements?

EPA and OSHA anticipate that better coordination under this MOU will result in improved workplace health and safety protections for workers using existing chemical substances under TSCA and the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act and allow for effective implementation of our national workplace and environmental protection statutes. Continuing the existing collaboration between EPA and OSHA on workplace exposures as part of EPA’s prioritization, risk evaluation, and risk management of existing chemicals, this MOU will further facilitate information sharing in the form of notification, consultation, and coordination where appropriate. EPA and OSHA will share information on: TSCA section 6 prioritization, risk evaluation, rulemaking and implementation efforts as it pertains to chemical hazards in the workplace. Outreach and communication materials for stakeholders about EPA rules and OSHA requirements, including TSCA section 6 and OSHA rules that regulate the same chemical hazards. Inspections and enforcement activity such as each agency’s areas of focus, complaints, inspections and potential violations where mutual interest exists. Protocols to ensure that confidential information is being properly exchanged between the agencies when carrying out law enforcement actions or otherwise protecting health or the environment. In the 1970s, the White House Council on Environmental Quality and EPA officials raised serious concerns about the health impacts of vinyl chloride, particularly on workers. These concerns were the impetus for Congress to write the “original TSCA” law in 1976 to ensure chemicals were made and used safely. The original TSCA contemplated EPA coordination with OSHA, and the ability of EPA to address chemical risks to workers. EPA wrote several worker-focused rules before TSCA was amended in 2016, including the Asbestos Worker Protection Rule, which extends the protection of the OSHA asbestos standards to those state and local government employees not covered by an OSHA-approved state plan. EPA restricted the use of some metalworking fluids in 1984 specifically to protect workers from cancer risks under TSCA. The 2016 amendments to TSCA expanded EPA’s authority and responsibility to protect workers. It requires EPA to consider potentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations in chemical risk evaluations, a category that explicitly includes workers. EPA and OSHA together have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and health of the public and the nation’s workforce through the timely and effective implementation of federal laws and regulations, including TSCA and the OSH Act. The standards for chemical hazards that OSHA promulgates under the OSH Act and that EPA promulgates under section 6(a) of TSCA share a broadly similar purpose, and the control measures OSHA and EPA require to satisfy the objectives of their respective statutes may overlap or coincide. However, and importantly, TSCA differs from the OSH Act in sev\"\n}\n***Web Page 7:***\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Chemical Hazards and Toxic Substances - Overview | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.osha.gov/chemical-hazards\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.osha.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Overview Transitioning to Safer <strong>Chemicals</strong>: A Toolkit for Employers and Workers American workers use tens of thousands of <strong>chemicals</strong> every day.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Vv0jSHS28xg2IBx_61KkNicz0lCjn_KyHxBnOqrOajA/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjI2ZGM2MjRj/YWEyZmYzODRjYjlj/NDFjMzIyNDNiODRi/NDFmMmUyYjI4ZmEw/MzhkYjk0Mjk4ZGM5/Y2U1NTFiOS93d3cu/b3NoYS5nb3Yv\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.osha.gov\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Can not fetch the page content.\"\n}\n***Web Page 8:***\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"OSHA's Regulated Chemicals | Environmental Health and Safety | Case Western Reserve University\",\n  \"url\": \"https://case.edu/ehs/safety-subject/chemical-safety/oshas-regulated-chemicals\",\n  \"site_name\": \"case.edu\",\n  \"snippet\": \"When working with OSHA’s <strong>25 regulated chemicals</strong>, you must report it to Environmental Health and Safety.

Home » About Us » Resources » What are Chemical Storage Safety OSHA Requirements Understanding OSHA Chemical Storage Requirements OSHA chemical storage requirements are essential for any company, laboratory or manufacturing facility working with hazardous materials. Specific federal regulations require safe chemical storage to protect humans, animals, property, and the environment. Hazardous materials, including biological, chemical, and radiological substances, can threaten health and safety if they leak or spill from their primary storage container . Regulatory agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set strict regulations for chemical storage. What Does OSHA Consider a Hazardous Chemical? According to OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) , a hazardous chemical is any chemical that can cause a physical or health hazard. This determination is made by the chemical manufacturer, as described in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d). Examples of hazardous materials include: Explosives Gases Oil-Filled Equipment Flammable or Combustible Liquids Flammable solids Oxidizing Agents and Organic Peroxides Toxic and Infectious Substances Radioactive Substances Corrosive Substances Other Miscellaneous Materials, Such as Asbestos OSHA Chemical Storage Safety Requirements Improperly transporting or containing chemicals can cause injuries. According to OSHA chemical storage requirements, workers should be aware of unsafe practices, such as improper handling and unhealthy situations. Hazardous chemicals pose health and safety risks even when workers are not transporting them. OSHA’s chemical storage requirements include the following basic legal guidelines: Employees must receive a written plan and training sessions to work with chemicals Chemicals must be accompanied by a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) SDSs must be readily available OSHA recommends workers follow certain steps to prevent hazards when storing chemicals: Keep storage areas free from clutter, explosives, and flammable conditions Prevent chemical storage conditions that may encourage rats or pests Place stored materials at least six feet from hoistways and at least 10 feet from exterior walls Separate chemicals that cannot be stored together How Do You Organize Chemical Storage? It’s important to understand chemical reactions and the risks involved with chemical containment. If you need to store chemicals in a small space, academic laboratory or stockroom, avoid storing chemicals on the floor or within c\"\n}\n***Web Page 19:***\n{\n  \"id\": 19,\n  \"title\": \"Learn the Basics of Hazardous Waste | US EPA\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-basics-hazardous-waste\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.epa.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Overview that includes the definition of <strong>hazardous</strong> waste, <strong>EPA</strong>’s Cradle-to-Grave <strong>Hazardous</strong> Waste Management Program, and <strong>hazardous</strong> waste generation, identification, transportation, recycling, treatment, storage, disposal and <strong>regulations</strong>.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/e9Xpm2vO4IcnPqyUHBJUfTmrWbSITIDSaIZQWYnhLCo/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMmI4MTBhNjQx/MDQ5ZDFlNmJhZWZi/Y2NlMjNkNzEzODYy/MjY1ZmQ2OTc0NjMy/OWFhZTBjYmU2ZmUw/ZTMxYWY1YS93d3cu/ZXBhLmdvdi8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.epa.gov\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Learn the Basics of Hazardous Waste | US EPA Skip to main content An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.

The cradle-to-grave hazardous waste management process Hazardous waste generation Hazardous waste transportation Hazardous waste recycling, treatment, storage and disposal Regulations for specific wastes EPA hazardous waste initiatives What is a Hazardous Waste? The hazardous waste management program uses the term solid waste to denote something that is a waste. EPA developed hazardous waste regulations that define in more detail what materials are solid waste for the purposes of RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste) regulation. Simply defined, a hazardous waste is a waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment. Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing process wastes to batteries and may come in many forms, including liquids, solids gases, and sludges. EPA developed a regulatory definition and process that identifies specific substances known to be hazardous and provides objective criteria for including other materials in the regulated hazardous waste universe. This identification process can be very complex, so EPA encourages generators of wastes to approach the issue using the series of questions described below: Click on a step in the hazardous waste identification process for more information. In order for a material to be classified as a hazardous waste, it must first be a solid waste. Therefore, the first step in the hazardous waste identification process is determining if a material is a solid waste. The second step in this process examines whether or not the waste is specifically excluded from regulation as a solid or hazardous waste. Once a generator determines that their waste meets the definition of a solid waste, they investigate whether or not the waste is a listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Finally, it is important to note that some facilities petitioned EPA to delist their wastes from RCRA Subtitle C regulation. You can research the facilities that successfully petitioned EPA for a delisting in Appendix IX of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 261 .

                "Output": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about regulations for hazardous chemicals under OSHA and EPA. From their search history, they've already looked into the science behind explosive reactions, household and commercial substances, and now they want the regulatory side. Their intent seems to be compiling comprehensive info for a project or report, possibly academic or professional compliance-related.\n\nFirst, I'll need to extract all relevant info from the provided web pages. Let's start by going through each page:\n\nPage 1 (EPA's EPCRA info): Talks about OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HazCom) defining hazardous chemicals. It mentions that chemicals are considered hazardous if they have physical or health hazards per OSHA's criteria. This is key because it defines what a hazardous chemical is under OSHA, which is foundational for regulations.\n\nPage 2 (DuraLabel's OSHA rules): Lists OSHA's regulations in 29 CFR parts 1910, subparts H and Z. Highlights specific standards like 1910.119 (Process Safety Management for highly hazardous chemicals), 1910.120 (HAZWOPER), and 1910.1200 (HazCom 2012). Also mentions EPA's role in areas like hazardous waste. This gives the structure of OSHA's regulations and their interplay with EPA.\n\nPage 3 (EPA's Hazardous Chemical Inventory): Explains that facilities must report hazardous chemicals (as per OSHA's HazCom) if they exceed certain thresholds. Thresholds vary, like 10,000 lbs for most chemicals. Also mentions Tier I/II reporting. This shows the EPA's reporting requirements tied to OSHA's definitions.\n\nPage 4 (OSHA Chemical Standards): Lists OSHA standards for chemical hazards, pointing to sections like 1910.119 and 1910.1200. Though content isn't fully fetched, the title and snippet confirm these are key standards.\n\nPage 5 (OSHA's Appendix A): Lists highly hazardous chemicals under 1910.119, like vinyl chloride and ammonia. Threshold quantities matter here. This is critical for understanding specific chemicals and their regulatory triggers.\n\nPage 6 (EPA & OSHA MOU): Discusses collaboration between EPA and OSHA, especially under TSCA section 6. They share info on chemical risks affecting workers. This shows coordinated efforts between agencies for worker safety.\n\nPage 7 (OSHA Chemical Hazards Overview): Mentions transitioning to safer chemicals and the HazCom standard. Though content isn't fully available, the overview suggests broader strategies beyond just compliance.\n\nPage 8 (Case Western's Regulated Chemicals): Lists 25 OSHA-regulated chemicals like benzene, lead, methylene chloride. Requires reporting to EHS if used. This gives specific examples of regulated chemicals under OSHA.\n\nPage 9 (EPCRA Sections 311-312): Similar to Page 1, emphasizes SDS submission and annual reporting to local authorities. Thresholds again important here.\n\nPage 10 (OSHA Final Rule on Process Safety): Focuses on managing highly hazardous chemicals and explosives under 29 CFR 1910.119. This rule ensures prevention programs and emergency responses.\n\nPage 11 (Lab Standard 1910.1450): Covers lab-specific OSHA regulations, requiring exposure assessments and control plans for hazardous chemicals in labs.\n\nPage 12 (HAZWOPER 1910.120): Details emergency response and hazardous waste operations. Applies to cleanup sites and facilities handling hazardous substances.\n\nPage 13 (Oregon OSHA): Mentions state-level rules, like manganese exposure limits. Indicates variability in state regulations but ties back to federal standards.\n\nPage 14 (HazCom Standard 1910.1200): The core OSHA standard for hazard communication, aligning with GHS. Requires labels, SDSs, and training.\n\nPage 15 (EPA Joint Safety Alert): Discusses improper storage risks, citing CERCLA, EPCRA, and CAA. Emphasizes storage, emergency response, and reporting requirements from both EPA and OSHA.\n\nPage 16-17 (OSHA Resources): Additional resources link to databases and exposure limits, reinforcing the need for SDS access and PELs.\n\nPage 18 (Polystar Containment): Practical storage guidelines, though third-party, highlight EPA and OSHA's secondary containment requirements to prevent spills.\n\nPage 19 (EPA Hazardous Waste Basics): Explains RCRA's role in hazardous waste management, linking to EPA's regulations on disposal, treatment, etc.\n\nPutting this together, the key points are:\n\n1. **OSHA Regulations**:\n   - **HazCom 29 CFR 1910.1200**: Requires SDSs, labeling, training. Defines hazardous chemicals (health/physical hazards).\n   - **Process Safety Management (PSM) 1910.119**: For highly hazardous chemicals (like those in Appendix A), mandates risk assessments, procedures, training.\n   - **HAZWOPER 1910.120**: Covers emergency response and hazardous waste sites.\n   - **Specific Chemical Standards**: Like 25 regulated chemicals (e.g., benzene, lead) requiring special handling and reporting.\n\n2. **EPA Regulations**:\n   - **EPCRA (Sections 311-312)**: Reporting requirements for facilities storing hazardous chemicals (as per OSHA's definition) exceeding thresholds.

Cleaning products and other hazardous household products are among the most dangerous poisons. Hazardous household products are stored for months or even years before they are used up or transported to a collection site. It is important to follow the use and storage guidelines below. Improper storage can be a safety hazard or turn usable products into waste. Follow all directions on the container. If the directions appear out of date, call the manufacturer. Store all products out of reach of children and pets. Lock poisons and medicines out of reach and sight of small children. Return hazardous household products to safe storage immediately after use. Always keep products in their original containers. If the product is removed from its original container, label it with the name of the product and the date you first stored the product in that container. Also include the name and phone number of the manufacturer and directions for safe use, storage and disposal. Never use food or beverage containers as replacement containers. Ensure the container is child-resistant. Never mix different household chemicals. Doing so could be dangerous. For example, mixing chlorine bleach with ammonia or vinegar can create toxic fumes. Store all hazardous products out of the sun, in tightly sealed containers, and away from heat, sparks and flames, including pilot lights. Never smoke or eat while handling hazardous materials. Never store products with hazardous ingredients in food or beverage containers. Also, never store these products in the same area as food. Keep containers dry to avoid rusting. Keep products from freezing. Never store in an unheated garage during the winter. An exception to this is products labeled \\\"Flammable\\\" or \\\"Combustible.\\\" They may be stored in an unheated garage during the winter. Never store gasoline or other fuels indoors. If the product container is deteriorating, place the entire container in a plastic bucket. Surround it with a nonflammable absorbent, such as kitty litter, vermiculite or floor dry, to absorb spills. Label the outside of the container as indicated above.

There are established\\nlegal requirements as well as recommended practices for storing chemicals. These requirements and\\nguidelines are summarized below in the following sections:\\n• General requirements\\n• Segregation of incompatible chemicals\\n• Specifications for chemical storerooms\\n• Chemical storage in laboratories (outside of chemical storerooms)\\n• Additional storage requirements and recommendations for specific hazard chemical classes\\nGeneral Requirements\\n1. Every chemical should have an identifiable storage place and should be returned to that location\\nafter use.\\n2. A storage scheme must be developed in each chemical storage area to ensure the segregation of\\nincompatibles and efforts must be made to isolate particularly flammable, reactive, and toxic\\nmaterials. An exclusively alphabetical storage scheme is prohibited.\\n3. Chemical storage on benchtops will be minimized in order to reduce the amounts of chemicals\\nunprotected from a potential fire or easily knocked over.\\n4. Compatible chemicals should be grouped by container size to make it easier to retrieve\\nchemicals and to reduce the possibility of bottle breakage.\\n5. Chemical storage in hoods will be minimized. Storing containers inside the hood interferes with\\nairflow, reduces and clutters up the work space, and provides fuel in a fire or explosion. Where\\npossible, chemicals will be stored in separate cabinets which vent directly into the fume hood.\\n6. Labels must be maintained on all stored materials.\\n7. Stored chemicals must not be exposed to direct sunlight or heat.\\n8. Storage trays should be used to minimize the spread of a spill.\\n9. Laboratory refrigerators must never be used to store food.\\n10. All chemicals containers left out of storage areas must be checked at the end of each workday.\\nUnneeded items must be returned to chemical storerooms or stockrooms.\\n11. Store acids (inorganic and some organic acids) in a dedicated acid cabinet. Oxidizing acids must\\nbe isolated from other acids (i.e., each in its own separate secondary containment).\\n12. Store flammables in a dedicated flammables cabinet. Acetic acid and acetic anhydride must be\\nstored in a flammable cabinet.\\n13. Store highly toxic chemicals in a dedicated cabinet.\\n14. Opening/expiration dates must be assigned to chemicals with the following functional\\ngroups/chemical properties:\\na. Picric acid and Picrates\\nb. Perchlorates\\nc. Peroxidesd. Peroxidizable materials (aldehydes, ethers, compounds containing benzylic hydrogen\\natoms). Peroxidizable materials must be tested routinely for peroxides\\ne. Monomers that polymerize violently or become hazardous after polymerization\\nf. Other materials known to deteriorate or become unstable or reactive over time\\n15. All laboratory personnel, on termination, transfer, or graduation must (in conjunction with the\\nlaboratory supervisor and CHO) arrange for the redistribution, removal or safe storage of all\\nhazardous materials remaining in their laboratory.\\n16. Appropriate spill control, clean-up and emergency equipment must be available wherever\\nchemicals are stored. See Chapter 8 for guidance in choosing these materials.\\nSegregation of Incompatible Chemicals\\nChemicals must not be arranged alphabetically or haphazardly in stockrooms or in laboratory work\\nareas. Alphabetical arrangement of chemicals can inadvertently place two incompatible chemicals next\\nto each other, which in the event that the containers break or leak could react violently. Some\\nexamples:\\nAcetic acid + Acetaldehyde = explosive reaction\\nAluminum metal + Ammonium nitrate = potential explosive\\nCupric sulfide + Cadmium chlorate = explode on contact\\nMercury II oxide + Magnesium metal = potential explosive\\nSodium nitrite + Sodium hypophosphite = explosive\\nNumerous approaches can be taken to segregate chemicals in storage. Different approaches may be\\nrequired depending upon the type and amount of space available for storage and the environmental\\nconditions of the spaces. Major considerations for segregation criteria should include water reactivity\\nand flammability. Special attention must be paid to the following chemicals due to their potential\\nreactivity:\\nINORGANIC Nitrates Nitrites ORGANIC\\nMetal azides Perchlorates Perchloric acid Ethers\\nPeroxides White phosphorus Phosphorus pentoxide Organic azides\\nParticular attention must be paid to isolating flammable, pyrophoric, peroxidizable, and toxic chemicals.\\nStorage of specific hazard classes of chemicals is discussed in greater detail below.\\nChemical Storage Area Specifications\\nStockrooms are facilities used for storing relatively large quantities of chemicals for laboratory use.\\nGeneral specifications for all chemical stockrooms:\\n Stockroom access must be strictly limited to specified personnel. All laboratories, preparation\\nrooms, and storeroom/stockrooms must be locked and secured when designated laboratory\\nemployees are not present. A mechanical exhaust ventilation system must be present and should provide at least 6 air\\nchanges per hour (FDNY). Additional local exhaust may be required if activities such as\\ndispensing take place in the storage area.\\n Each storage area should have at least 1 large sink, safety shower, eyewash station, and must\\nhave an appropriate fire extinguisher with adequate extinguishing capacity.\\n Each chemical storage area should have a master control shut-off valve for water, electricity,\\nand utility gas.\\n Shelf assemblies must be firmly secured to walls.

( Print friendly PDF ) Introduction Household chemical products can be extremely dangerous. When used incorrectly, they can create poisonous gases that can cause severe health problems. Additionally, many household chemicals include corrosive materials that can cause property damage and serious bodily injury when not handled properly. A corrosive material is one that will destroy and damage other substances it comes into contact with. Some household chemicals are flammable. When not handled properly, these chemicals can cause fires or explosions. Because of these dangers, it is critical that household chemicals be used safely. Further, they must be disposed of safely to avoid harming people or the environment. Household chemicals can sometimes be referred to as “household hazardous waste.” These chemicals are safe when used according to the directions on the label provided by the manufacturer. However, whether stated in the manufacturer’s directions or not, it is wise to wear gloves and eye protection when using household chemicals. Hazardous chemical waste products can include acids, paints, poisons, and solvents. When buying these products, you should purchase only what you need and reuse as much as possible. Use non-hazardous alternative products and materials when possible (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation [NYSDEC], n.d.). For more information on how to make your own non-hazardous cleaning products, see NMSU Extension Guide G-313, Green Alternatives to Toxic Household Products and Hazardous Waste ( https://pubs.nmsu.edu/_g/G313.pdf ). NEVER dispose of hazardous wastes down the sink drain or the toilet because this can pollute drinking water. Additionally, do not dump any household chemicals on the ground. Chemicals may flow into surface waters and eventually into groundwater sources where, again, they can pollute drinking water. Do not burn waste products since they can release toxic fumes or gases into the air. The best way to safely dispose of household chemicals is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. Some household chemicals need to be taken to local hazardous waste management sites. Check with your local environmental health department, solid waste agency, or fire department for information on disposal options in your area. What follows are suggested guidelines for disposing of household chemicals safely. © rawpixel | Unspalsh.com Table 1 lists important information to follow when using household chemicals. Take time to read it and display it in a prominent area in your home. Be sure to fill in the telephone numbers of your medical care provider and fire department. Acids and bases . Acids are found in cleaning products such as toilet bowl cleaners, drain cleaners, and swimming pool chemicals. The product ingredient label usually contains the word “acid.” Bases are corrosives. They can be found in bleaches, oven cleaners, drain cleaners, and disinfectants. The ingredients list may have such terms as lye, hydroxide, and hypochlorite. The best way to dispose of acids and bases is to use the entire product. If you do have leftover chemicals you will not use or cannot give to someone else, save them for a household hazardous waste collection program. Check with your local environmental, health, or solid waste agency for information on household hazardous waste management options in your area. Aerosols . Empty aerosol containers can be dangerous because the containers may explode under heat or pressure. Completely empty the container before discarding it with other household trash. Check with your local recycler to see if aerosol cans are eligible for recycling in your area. If the product is not hazardous, empty the container by spraying it outdoors into an empty box or paper bag. Allow the contents to dry completely before discarding along with household trash. If the product is hazardous, store it until a household hazardous waste collection program is available in your area (NYSDEC, n.d.). Antifreeze . Store out of reach of animals and children. They are attracted to the sweet taste of the antifreeze. Do not pour used antifreeze down the drain or on the ground. Take any used or unused antifreeze needing disposal to a local hazardous waste management site. Antifreeze can be recycled. Check with a local garage, public works department, or motor vehicle salvage yard to see if you can recycle your antifreeze with theirs (NYSDEC, n.d.). Bleach . Try to use all the product. NEVER mix chlorine bleach with ammonia or acidic products, such as drain cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, or metal cleaners, because it will release toxic fumes strong enough to be fatal. Any leftover bleach can be flushed down the toilet or washed down a drain followed with plenty of water. Cleaners and polishes . Cleaners and polishes (rug cleaner and floor and furniture polish) should be used completely whenever possible. Check the manufacturer’s directions for proper disposal. Unless instructed otherwise, seal empty containers and dispose of them with the rest of your household garbage (Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, 2010). Oven cleaners: Small amounts of oven cleaners made without sodium hydroxide or lye can be flushed down kitchen drains or toilets with plenty of water. Cleaners containing sodium hydroxide or lye should be disposed of through a household hazardous waste collection program. If a product is normally flushed down the drain during use, as most cleaners and detergents are, the product can usually be disposed of by pouring it down the drain slowly with running water. Never pour metal polishes, wood polishes, waxes, and other solvent-based cleaners down the drain. Instead, store them until you can dispose of them with a household hazardous waste collection program. Disinfectants . Most of these products contain strong chemicals. Use the products comple\"\n}\n***Web Page 5:***\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Home Hazardous Materials\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/home-fires/prevent-fires/home-hazardous-materials/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"www.usfa.fema.gov\",\n  \"snippet\": \"<strong>Safety</strong> tips include use, <strong>storage</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>disposal</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>household</strong> <strong>chemicals</strong>.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/ZaYLZRulgalVfZnoK1xdzeWBl5C_K7LhihX0FzVEtRw/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjIyMzg3YTMw/ZGYxNjgwN2Q5OTdh/ODgwZDc1NWNmOWUz/OTYxMmMyMDZlNDFl/N2JhMTRhZGIzNDA3/MGEzNDE0Ny93d3cu/dXNmYS5mZW1hLmdv/di8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"www.usfa.fema.gov\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \"Home Hazardous Materials Skip to main content An official website of the United States government Here's how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.

However, some products can cause harm if they are improperly used, stored, or thrown away. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Safer Choice website has healthier alternatives for you, your family, and the environment. Learn more about recycling and composting to reduce waste. Only buy what you need Research online and talk with experts (like local hardware stores) to determine what products you need. If you purchase what you need for your project, you won't need to store or get rid of the excess products. Store chemicals away from children Children are more vulnerable to being harmed by chemicals since they are smaller and put a lot of items in their mouth. Store products high out of the reach of children or in locked cabinets. Keep hazards, like mercury and medications, away from kids Clean up mercury spills properly . Do not vacuum mercury. Household medications should be kept locked or out of reach of children. Follow product labels Product labels contain instructions on how to use that specific product. Pay attention to product warnings, such as never mixing ammonia and bleach as it creates chlorine gas, which can be deadly. Dispose of your hazards properly Review the Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) guidance on management of household hazardous waste to learn about a variety of waste collection and exchange programs, including when you should take products to a store for disposal (like used engine oil and compact fluorescent lightbulbs) or when you can throw out the products. The following options may help in removing old products. Clean Sweep is a Department of Agriculture Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) grant program that provides reimbursement to communities that collect and dispose of household hazardous wastes, agricultural pesticides, and prescription drugs. View the 2018 Clean Sweep communities list . Local Solid Waste Department: Your local solid waste department may have more information on disposal guidelines and collection schedules in your area.

Safe storage methods may differ, but instructions are typically provided on the product label or directions enclosed with the packaging. Look for symbols on the label that indicate flammable, corrosive or toxic hazards. If in doubt, contact the retailer and request a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). The MSDS provides key information and safety recommendations related to the product. Safe storage of household chemicals Store flammable liquids preferably outside in a metal cabinet or in an unheated area. Never store near an open flame or spark. Flammable liquids include gasoline, camp stove fuel, paint thinner and lamp oil. Store corrosive materials in a place such as a plastic tub or tray where the product can't spill out if the container leaks. Examples of corrosive materials include drain cleaners, bleach and acids. Store out of the reach of children and pets. Household chemicals should never be accessible to those who are not aware of their proper use or application. In some cases, a label may recommend not storing one product with another. Take care to separate the products into different storage areas. Look for alternatives to household chemicals There are many environmentally friendly household products on the market today. When possible use these products instead of household chemicals.

Do you know what to do if someone is poisoned? The Victorian Poisons Information Centre External Link (Tel. 13 11 26 ) received 40,918 calls in 2020 – an average of 112 calls per day. Of this total, 82 per cent were calls about exposure to a poison; and 19,349 related to children under 15 years. Before you buy a product, read the label. Before you use a product, read the label and then follow the instructions for use. When you use a chemical product, follow the instructions. Make sure you have the recommended protective equipment (such as gloves, safety goggles and a face mask), and work in a well ventilated area. Although rare, some people who are poisoned end up in hospital, and some die. So, it pays to know what chemicals are in your home, and how to prevent an accidental poisoning. Watch out for these chemicals in your home You may already know that some common household products contain potentially dangerous chemicals. These products include, among others: cleaning agents such as bleaches, dishwasher powders, oven cleaners, drain cleaners and turpentine pest control products weed killers other gardening products swimming pool chemicals liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Many medications such as analgesics (pain relievers), diabetes medicines, iron tablets, sedatives, heart and blood pressure tablets can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. While an adult may know not to swallow these products (or to swallow medicines only in the prescribed dose), a child might think they are safe to touch or eat or drink . You and your family can live safely with these chemicals around your home if you store and use them correctly (away from children ). Storing chemicals safely at home Store and use all chemicals according to the instructions on the packaging. Chemicals may be toxic or flammable, and they may create a poisonous gas or liquid when mixed. Remember to always keep chemicals in their original containers, never in cups or soft drink bottles. Safety tips for storing chemicals in your home Try to find the least dangerous product that will do the job, especially if there are children in the house. Keep chemicals in a locked cabinet out of the reach of children (including children who are good climbers!). If you can, keep liquid chemicals away from (or below) dry chemicals. If you are using chemical cleaners, wash the cleaning rags before you use them again or before throwing them out. Keep chemicals in their original packaging, so you can easily identify them. Do not keep chemicals in: unlabelled containers containers that the product may react with or degrade containers that originally stored a different product (particularly a food or drink product) containers that cannot be sealed. If you have to repackage a product, make sure it is clearly labelled. Do not use chemicals for anything other than their intended job. When you are finished with a chemical do not pour it down the drain, toilet or gutter. Follow any special storage instructions (for example, keeping flammable liquids away from heat, keeping medicines in a cool place, and keeping acids away from alkaline products). Check regularly that storage containers are not damaged or leaking, especially if you are storing chemicals for a long time. You are legally required to store pesticides in their original containers, and those containers must meet the labelling requirements for poison External Link . Disposing of household chemicals safely Some household chemicals must not be thrown into your regular rubbish. The following chemicals need special disposal: Ionisation type smoke alarms – these are slightly radioactive.

Laboratory workers should date containers with the day, month and year they are first opened and first received. This is required for materials that have potential to form organic peroxides and recommended for all other materials. Laboratories should minimize chemical storage to only those chemicals which will be actively used. Laboratory doors should remain closed at all times. Workers should not use chemicals or equipment if they have not been trained to do so. Use the following chemical storage guidelines for work with specific chemical hazards: General Chemical Safety Guidelines Acids Store large bottles of acids on low shelves or on trays in acid cabinets or a cabinet marked “corrosives” Segregate oxidizing acids from organic acids, flammable and combustible materials. Segregate acids from bases, active metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other incompatible materials. Use bottle carriers or a cart to transporting acid bottles. Have spill control pillows or acid neutralizers available in the event of a spill. Do not use bases to neutralize acid spill. Bases Segregate bases from acids and other incompatible materials. Store large bottles of liquid bases on trays in a cabinet marked “Bases” or “Corrosives”. Store solutions of inorganic hydroxides in polyethylene containers. Have spill control pillows or caustic neutralizers available for caustic spills. Do not use acids to neutralize base spills. Flammables Only store flammable liquids in a specially equipped flammable-safe refrigerator or flammables cabinet. Keep away from sources of ignition. Keep fire extinguishing and spill control equipment readily available. For flammable metals, have a Class-D fire extinguisher available. See “fire extinguishers” for more information. Oxidizers Store in a cool, dry area Store away from flammable and combustible materials, such as paper, wood, etc.. Peroxide-Forming Chemicals Date the container when received and when opened. Store in airtight containers in a dark, cool, dry area. Check container for formation of peroxides, as needed, using appropriate indicator strips. Dispose of peroxide forming chemicals on or before expiration date or one year after opening, whichever is first. Compressed Gases Store in a secure and upright position.

Chemical storage is complex—there is no one-size-fits-all plan to store chemicals—but there are regulations, campus requirements, and best practices that can guide the process. The general concept is to prevent chemicals from causing harm to people, property, other chemicals, or the environment. In order to fully understand the hazards associated with stored chemicals you first need to know what chemicals are being stored. Safe storage begins with an up-to-date inventory of chemicals and knowledge of the hazards posed by each chemical General Storage Requirements All chemicals must be stored in a safe, secure location. Shelves should be level, stable, and secured to the wall or another stable Store chemicals away from direct sunlight, sources of heat, and egress pathways Hazardous chemicals must be stored below eye level. Do not store chemicals on the floor, window ledges, or balconies. Keep containers closed unless you are dispensing a chemical or adding to the container. Provide secondary containment for liquids whenever possible. Dishpans or polyethylene trays work Don’t store chemicals in a sink or fume hood, except for certain toxic gases that are so dangerous they can only be stored in a gas cabinet or fume Label containers, and be sure container is compatible with the chemical Use rated storage cabinets or safety cans whenever possible—required for >10 gal. of flammables. Cold rooms, refrigerators, and freezers have additional requirements, particularly for flammables. Chemical Segregation Chemicals should always be segregated according to their specific hazard(s) to prevent unintended reactions. Begin by categorizing and separating chemicals by the following categories. Note that the order is intentional, as discussed below. Pyrophorics Water reactives Flammables Corrosives Oxidizers Toxics Other types of materials require more specific storage requirements such as Explosives Compressed gases Cryogens As a general rule, chemicals need to be physically segregated from incompatible chemicals; some key requirements are listed below.

By implementing these guidelines, laboratories can ensure safer storage of chemicals and enhance the general housekeeping and organization of the lab. Proper storage of chemicals also helps utilize limited laboratory space in a more efficient manner. All chemical containers MUST be labeled . Labels should include the name of the chemical constituent(s) and any hazards present. Be sure to check chemical containers regularly and replace any labels that are deteriorating or falling off and/or relabel with another label before the chemical becomes an unknown. Keep all containers of chemicals closed when not in use. Every chemical should have an identifiable storage place and should be returned to that location after use. Secondary containment is meant to contain chemicals in the event of a leak or spill. The containment must be big enough to hold 110% of the contents of the primary container. The storage of chemicals on bench tops should be kept to a minimum to help prevent clutter and spills, and to allow for adequate working space. Chemical storage in fume hoods should be kept to a minimum - limited to the experiment being conducted. Excess storage of chemical containers in hoods can interfere with airflow, reduce working space, and increase the risk of a spill, fire, or explosion. For chemical storage cabinets, larger chemical bottles should be stored towards the back and smaller bottles should be stored up front where they are visible. Chemical bottles should be turned with the labels facing out so they can be easily read. Chemicals should not be stored on the floor due to the potential for bottles to be knocked over and result in a spill. If it is necessary to store bottles on the floor, then the bottles should be placed in secondary containment, such as trays, and the bottles should be placed away from aisle spaces. For multiples of the same chemical, older containers should be stored in front of newer chemicals and containers with the least amount of chemical should be stored in front of full containers. This allows for older chemicals to get used up first and helps to minimize the number of chemical containers in the storage area. Do not store chemicals in direct sunlight or next to heat sources. Laboratories should strive to keep only the minimum quantity of chemicals necessary. When ordering new chemicals, laboratories should only order enough stock needed for the experiment or the quantity that will get used up within 1 or 2 years at most. Liquid chemical containers should be stored in secondary containment, such as trays, to minimize the potential for bottle breakage and minimize the potential for spills. Always segregate and store chemicals according to compatibility and hazard classes. Chemical containers should be dated when they arrive and should be checked regularly and disposed of when they get past their expiration date. Please Note : Due to the potential explosion hazard, peroxide forming chemicals are required to be tested and dated. Flammable liquids in excess of quantities for specific flammability classes must be stored in approved flammable liquid storage cabinets. Do not store acids in flammable liquid storage cabinets. This can result in serious degradation of the storage cabinet and the containers inside.

Risk minimization depends upon safe practices, appropriate engineering controls, the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment, the use of the least quantity of chemicals necessary, and when possible, the substitution of less hazardous chemicals. Essentially, chemical safety is inherently linked to other safety issues. Hazard vs. Risk There is a difference between hazard and risk, although the 2 terms are frequently used synonymously. Of the two, a hazard is a much more complex concept, in that it involves conditions of use. The hazard presented by a chemical has two component considerations: Its inherent capacity to do harm by virtue of its toxicity, flammability, explosiveness, corrosiveness, etc. The ease with which the chemical can come into contact with a person or object of concern. The 2 components combined determine risk, i.e., the likelihood or probability that a chemical will cause harm. Thus, an extremely toxic chemical such as strychnine cannot cause poisoning if it is sealed in a container and does not contact the handler: High hazard, low risk. In contrast, a chemical that is not highly toxic but comes in contact with the handler’s skin over a long period of time can be lethal: Low hazard, high risk. Chemical Safety Guidelines Assume that any unfamiliar chemical is hazardous. Know all the hazards of the chemicals that you work with. Consider each mixture of chemicals to be at least as hazardous as its most hazardous component chemical. Never use any substance that is not properly labeled. Follow all chemical safety instructions precisely. Minimize your exposure to any chemical, regardless of its hazard rating. Use personal protective equipment as appropriate. Avoid repeated exposure to any chemical is unprotected. Chemical Handling Guidelines When working with chemicals: Remove and use only the amount of chemicals needed for the immediate job at hand. Properly seal, label, and store chemicals in appropriate containers. Check stored chemicals for deterioration and broken containers. Do not store chemicals near heat or sunlight or near substances which might initiate a dangerous reaction if combined. Do not pour hazardous chemicals down sink drains.

Products, such as paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, and pesticides can contain hazardous ingredients and require special care when you dispose of them. On this page: Safe management of HHW Reducing HHW in your home Regulating HHW Related Links Safe Management of HHW Safe Disposal and Recycling Many communities have collection programs for HHW to reduce potential harm posed by these chemicals. Search for \\\"household hazardous waste\\\" near your zip code in the Earth 911 database for more information. Contact your local environmental, health, or solid waste agency to learn about permanent or periodic HHW collections near you. To avoid the potential risks associated with household hazardous wastes, it is important that people always monitor the use, storage, and disposal of products with potentially hazardous substances in their homes. Improper disposal of HHW can include pouring them down the drain, on the ground, into storm sewers, or in some cases putting them out with the regular trash. The dangers of such disposal methods might not be immediately obvious, but improper disposal of these wastes can pollute the environment and pose a threat to human health. Certain types of HHW have the potential to cause physical injury to sanitation workers, contaminate septic tanks or wastewater treatment systems if poured down drains or toilets. They can also present hazards to children and pets if left around the house. Some quick tips for the safe handling of household hazardous wastes include: Follow any instructions for use and storage provided on product labels carefully to prevent any accidents at home. Be sure to read product labels for disposal directions to reduce the risk of products exploding, igniting, leaking, mixing with other chemicals, or posing other hazards on the way to a disposal facility. Never store hazardous products in food containers; keep them in their original containers and never remove labels. Corroding containers, however, require special handling. Call your local hazardous materials official or fire department for instructions. When leftovers remain, never mix HHW with other products.

All chemicals should be stored in such a manner as to prevent incompatible materials from being accidentally mixed together in the event of the breakage of one or more containers in the storage area, or to prevent the formation and build-up of reactive vapours. The correct storage of chemicals within storage areas / stock rooms, workshops and laboratories is an on-going problem which can sometimes be complex and potentially confusing. The overall purpose of correct storage is to maintain control over the chemicals so that they can be both stored and retrieved safely. COSHH forms and risk assessments must consider the storage of substances as well as their use COSHH Risk Assessment Many chemicals, including waste chemicals awaiting safe disposal, have special storage requirements with temperature, time, or security restrictions and practical problems can arise because of the number of separations that could be desirable. Correct storage must address the compatibility issues of flammable substances, unstable materials, highly reactive chemicals and vapours of highly toxic materials. Safe storage of chemicals can be achieved by arranging the materials to provide separation based on their chemical properties. This requires planning and will involve, an inventory list, accurate labelling, an appreciation of chemical incompatibilities and a range of suitable containers and storage facilities. In essence, the most important reasons for proper chemical storage are: to provide for effective management of chemicals to lessen the risk of fire to prevent accidental mixing in emergencies to minimise exposure to corrosive and toxic chemicals to comply with relevant statutory security obligations Accidents resulting from poor chemical storage techniques are preventable and appendix 1 lists some common examples of improper storage practices to avoid. Chemical Storage Facilities General Considerations Safe storage of chemicals must begin with identification of the chemicals to be stored and their intrinsic hazardous properties. Since many chemicals have several hazards, which may vary in degree of severity, depending on quantity and concentration, it is not always straight forward to determine what protection is needed for safe storage and where best to store a particular chemical. However, typical storage considerations may include temperature, ignition control, ventilation, segregation and identification. Separation (i.e. use of distance), segregation (i.e. use of a physical boundary) or isolation is recommended depending upon the severity of hazard, total quantities stored, and the size, break resistance and durability of individual containers (i.e. fragility of glass bottles, perforation or degradation of plastic containers, and corrosion or puncture of metal containers). Hence, the physical composition and even the size of storage containers may also affect the need for special storage practi\"\n}\n***Web Page 15:***\n{\n  \"id\": 15,\n  \"title\": \"How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste\",\n  \"url\": \"https://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/research-lab/hazardous-waste/chemical.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"blink.ucsd.edu\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Learn how to contain, store, and <strong>dispose</strong> of hazardous <strong>chemical</strong> waste at UC San Diego.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"family_friendly\": true,\n  \"reading_time\": null,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"favicon\": \"https://imgs.search.brave.com/aVVcw0poOEr4uouySFX-DNMs2aK6z2SWlp7wV9uoymo/rs:fit:32:32:1:0/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWJiMmE5M2Rl/ZDg3NjIyZjMxNzNl/YTA1ZmNmODAxYjIw/YjdiOGYwNzhkZDU1/MTFjNTc2OTlkOTBi/YzE5NDBkZi9ibGlu/ay51Y3NkLmVkdS8\",\n    \"hostname\": \"blink.ucsd.edu\"\n  },\n  \"page_info\": \" HireOnline JDOnline Logistics Portal MyMobileBill Onboarding Oracle Procurement PADUA PaymentWorks Performance Appraisals SPARCM (login required) STAR Title & Pay Look-up Tracker I-9 Complete UCPath VPN Instruction ASSIST Canvas Class lists Classroom details Co-Curricular Record eGrades Enrollment/waitlists Find a student General Catalog Majors list Minors list Queries Schedule of Classes Student Directory Term Audit Research Services & Support Faculty Expertise Kuali Research MyEffort My Research Safety Research Development Training Resources Resources For: Finance Admin Research Admin All Tools TOOLS: Personal Compensation Calculator Concur Travel & Expense Educational Benefits Job Bulletin My Directory Ecotime Campus My Training Performance Appraisal UC Learning Center UCnet UCPath UCRAYS Business Services & Support Concur Travel & Expense Oracle Financials Cloud AP On-Line Business Analytics Hub (BAH) Campus Space Management (Tririga) CAMS Ecotime Campus E-Markets EmployeeLink FinancialLink HireOnline JDOnline Logistics Portal MyMobileBill Onboarding PADUA PaymentWorks Performance Appraisals SPARCM (login required) STAR Title & Pay Look-up Tracker I-9 Complete UCPath VPN Instruction ASSIST Canvas Class lists Classroom details Co-Curricular Record eGrades Enrollment/waitlists Find a student General Catalog Majors list Minors list Queries Schedule of Classes Student Directory Term Audit Research Services & Support Faculty Expertise Kuali Research MyEffort My Research Safety Research Development Training Resources Resources for: Finance Admin Research Admin All Faculty & Staff Home Safety Research Safety Hazardous Waste Disposal Guidance How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste Last Updated: March 3, 2024 7:54:02 AM PST Give feedback Learn how to contain, store and dispose of hazardous chemical waste at UC San Diego.

Follow these procedures for selecting containers and safely storing hazardous chemical waste until it is collected by Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S). Is it \\\"hazardous\\\" or \\\"extremely hazardous\\\"? Procedures and requirements are different for hazardous and extremely hazardous chemical waste. Check the list of Known Hazardous and Extremely Hazardous Waste for your material. If your material is listed as hazardous, use the guidelines on this page. If your material is listed as extremely hazardous, proceed to How to Store and Dispose of Extremely Hazardous Chemical Waste . Designate a hazardous waste storage area Select an area that is: Near where the waste is generated Under the control of lab personnel Out of the way of normal lab activities Label the area with a \\\"Danger – Hazardous Waste\\\" sign. This sign is available upon request from EH&S Environmental Management Facility , (858) 534-2753. Make the area easily accessible and recognizable to EH&S waste technicians. Note: Fume hoods may be used to temporarily store small quantities of waste materials, but should not serve as designated waste storage areas. Select compatible containers Chemical compatibility: Choose a container chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. Follow these basic compatibility guidelines: Acids or bases: Do not store in metal. Hydrofluoric acid: Do not store in glass. Gasoline (solvents): Do not store or transport in lightweight polyethylene containers such as milk jugs. Read Chemical Compatibility Guidelines for more detailed information.

The quantities of chemicals that are stored within a laboratory should be minimized, as specified by NFPA 45 and OSHA. Bulk quantities of chemicals (i.e., larger than one gallon) must be stored in a separate storage area. Transfer of flammable liquid from five gallon or larger metal containers may not be done in the laboratory. Chemicals should be stored in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended temperature and humidity level. Chemicals should not be stored near heat sources, such as steam pipes or laboratory ovens. Chemical s should never be stored in direct sunlight . Chemicals should be dated when received and when opened. Time-sensitive chemicals should also include an expiration date . Visual inspection of the material and its container should be conducted routinely. Indications for disposal include: Cloudiness in liquids Material changing color Evidence of liquids in solids or solids in liquids “Puddling” of material around outside of container or pressure build-up within bottle Obvious deterioration of container Chemicals should not be routinely stored on the benchtops. In such locations they are unprotected from exposure and participation in a fire situation and are also more readily knocked over. Each chemical should have a specific storage area and be returned there after use. Large quantities of flammable materials should not be stored in the laboratory. Only the amounts needed should be kept on benchtops, the remainder should be kept in flammable storage cabinets. Laboratory shelves should have a raised lip along the outer edge to prevent containers from falling. Never allow chemical containers to extend over the edge of the shelf. Liquid or corrosive chemicals should never be stored on shelves above eye-level. Glass containers should not touch each other on the shelves. Secondary containers or trays should be used for chemical storage whenever possible to minimize the flow of material should a spill or rupture occur. Round bottom flasks should always be supported properly in cork rings or by other means to keep them from tipping. Adequate security must be provi\"\n}\n***Web Page 17:***\n{\n  \"id\": 17,\n  \"title\": \"Handling and Storage | University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science\",\n  \"url\": \"https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/chemical-engineering/safety/handling-and-storage\",\n  \"site_name\": \"engineering.virginia.edu\",\n  \"snippet\": \"If a <strong>chemical</strong> label is present, it should be removed or defaced.

Work that involves heating or evaporating concentrated perchloric acid must be performed in a special Perchloric Acid Fume Hood . These devices have self-contained water rinsing and wash- down features to minimize the formation and accumulation of reactive crystals. These are available in select labs in Jesser and Wilsdorf Halls. All chemicals must be correctly and clearly labeled and kept in capped containers. Parafilm and aluminum foil are not acceptable for long-term storage of chemicals. Screw caps should be used whenever possible Post warning signs when unusual hazards, such as radiation, flammable materials, biological hazards, or other special problems exist. It is recommended that you place your initials and date on the label of any chemical container. Chemical splash goggles (or face shields) and rubber gloves should be worn when concentrated acids are poured. Such equipment must also be worn when any highly reactive or toxic chemicals are handled, such as elemental sodium or cyanide. All chemicals must be organized and stored on shelves or in cabinets where they will not be knocked over. One way to organize chemicals is to store organics by number of Carbon atoms and keep them separate from inorganics, which should be stored in alphabetical order. Upon receipt, date and initial the label so that the age of the stock can be determined. All chemicals in the laboratory must be labeled with permanent labels . The label should indicate the full chemical name and the primary hazard associated with the substance (e.g., flammable, toxic). Do not use abbreviations. Include your initials and date. Discarding containers- UNBROKEN chemical reagent, salt, and solvent bottles can be discarded in trash bins once they are THOROUGHLY RINSED. If a chemical label is present, it should be removed or defaced. Only \\\"non-hazardous materials,\\\" may be poured into a sink . For all other materials follow the waste disposal guidelines in SECTION X) . Concentrated acids and bases can be removed by the Environmental Health and Safety Office. Contact the EHS Office If you are unsure. Dichromate in Sulfuric acid and other strong acid or oxidizer cleaning solutions should not be used for general cleaning purposes. Due to liberation of extremely toxic chromyl chlorides, Dichromate/Sulfuric acid is approved for use only in fume hoods. Concentrated acids and bases should be stored in containment trays, separated from all other chemicals. They should not be stored on high shelves. Acids and Bases Should Be Stored in Separate Cabinets. Peroxides, hydroperoxides, and peroxyesters - these compounds are all active oxygen- containing materials which can decompose generating oxygen or oxidizing agents. These materials are chemically unstable to varying degrees. Many organic compounds, including the following types, are known to form extremely dangerous peroxides. Aldehydes and Ketones, Ethers, especially cyclic ethers such as THF. Compounds containing benzylic hydrogen atoms, e.g. cumene. Compounds containing the allylene (CH2=CHCH2R structure). Vinyl and vinylidene compounds, e.g., vinyl acetate and vinylidene chloride. Examples of common materials which form dangerous peroxides upon long exposure to air are: Cyclohexene, Cyclooctene, Decalin, p-Dioxane, Ethyl ether, Isopropyl ether, Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Tetralin. Disposal of Peroxides - Do not mix with other chemicals for disposal – keep in a separate contained properly labeled for disposal by EHS. Special Precautions Are Needed for Other Especially Hazardous Chemicals: Picric acid, which is highly shock sensitive, Ethers, can form highly unstable peroxides, should be discarded after 6 months, Triethyl aluminum, which is highly pyrophoric, Lithium aluminum hydride, which is highly water reactive, Piranha solution, which is a strong corrosive and oxidizer.

Ensure all stored containers are in good condition, closed, and properly labeled. Store all hazardous materials in containers, cabinets, or on shelving compatible with the associated hazard or material. Segregate chemicals by hazard class (flammable liquids, organic acids, oxidizers). Chemicals that belong in the same hazard class may be stored alphabetically. You can refer to the Chemical Storage Guidelines (PDF) for an overview of this information. Use secondary containment for all liquid hazardous materials to prevent environmental release. Hazardous liquids should be stored less than 60 inches from the floor. Secure all storage shelves and cabinets to the wall to prevent tipping. Ensure that storage locations are dry, adequately vented, and away from heat sources. Provide inventories of hazardous materials stored in the laboratory annually to EH&S. Update the inventory upon significant changes in amounts or processes. Additional requirements for specific hazardous materials are described in Section G of the Laboratory Safety Manual (PDF) or may be obtained from the safety data sheet (SDS), container label, or laboratory standard operating procedure (SOP). Safely handling chemicals Below are some general guidelines for the safe use of chemical, biological, and radiological materials: Before use, review the hazard information on the container label in an SDS or equivalent (Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, Merck Index). Follow safety precautions as specified in the approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Use the appropriate equipment for processes that release hazardous vapors, fumes, particulates, or aerosols. To determine the appropriate equipment, refer to \\\"Chemical Fume Hoods\\\" in the appendix of the Laboratory Safety Manual (PDF). Separate incompatible materials. Do not leave hazardous processes unattended. Do not pipette or siphon by mouth. Do not smell or taste chemical, biological, or radiological materials. Ensure that all containers are properly closed when not in use. Work with the minimum amount necessary for the procedure. Return excess materials to storage. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment. For more details, refer to “Personal Protective Equipment” in Section D of the Laboratory Safety Manual (PDF). Avoid working alone in the laboratory, especially if using hazardous materials. When unavoidable, make arrangements with the PI, laboratory supervisor, or a colleague to periodically check on your status.

Getting to know the labels on chemical products will help protect you and your family from harm. Chemical products in the home Cleaning products like bleach, oven sprays, liquid laundry capsules and toilet cleaners are chemicals. So are paints, glues, oils, pesticides and medicines. The liquid that is used for electric cigarettes is highly toxic to children and pets.  They have an attractive smell so should be treated and stored as a chemical. You should be aware of all the chemicals present in your home.  Most of them aren’t dangerous if you use them properly. However, many chemicals need more careful handling than others. Some chemicals are particularly attractive to children or can be confused as food or drink if they are not stored in their original containers and safely out of reach.  For example, bleach and cleaning sprays are often stored behind the toilet for convenience. They must be removed and placed in a locked cupboard out of reach and sight of children. Labels can help you identify the more hazardous chemicals, tell you what the dangers are and advise how to use them safely. Recognising chemicals Most chemical products carry hazard symbols telling you whether a substance is harmful and in what way. You might see one or more symbols on a single product. There are nine chemical product symbols. Meaning Symbol Very toxic (fatal) What does it mean?

        "SearchPlan": "Okay, the user wants a detailed plan to search the web for their question about explosive reactions and related substances. Let me break down their query first. They’re asking about the science behind explosive reactions, common household or commercial substances that can be hazardous if misused, how these materials are regulated, and safety precautions.\n\nFirst, I need to start with the basics of explosive reactions. So step one should be researching the fundamental science: what makes a reaction explosive. I should look into concepts like exothermic reactions, rapid energy release, and factors like heat, pressure, and gas production. Maybe check how things like activation energy and reaction rates play a role.\n\nNext, common household substances. The user mentioned both household and commercial. So step two would involve listing everyday items that can be explosive when misused. Think about things like bleach and ammonia mixing, which creates toxic gas, or maybe cleaning products. Also, commercial substances like fertilizers (ammonium nitrate comes to mind) or certain solvents. Need to ensure I cover both categories thoroughly.\n\nThen, step three should be about the specific properties of these substances that make them hazardous. For each substance identified, what makes them prone to explosive reactions? For example, ammonium nitrate is a strong oxidizer, so when combined with fuels, it can detonate. Maybe look into oxidizers, fuels, and how their combination leads to explosions.\n\nMoving on to regulations. Step four would be researching how these materials are regulated. Different countries might have different laws, but maybe focus on major ones like the US, EU, or others. Look into agencies like OSHA, EPA, or international bodies. Also, check regulations on storage, handling, and sale of such substances. Maybe things like licensing for commercial use or restrictions on quantities for household products.\n\nStep five should cover public safety measures. How do these regulations actually protect people? Maybe through mandatory labeling, safety data sheets (SDS), or public education campaigns. Also, how do authorities enforce these regulations? Inspections, penalties for non-compliance, etc.\n\nNow, the user also wants precautions individuals can take. Step six would be gathering tips for safe handling. This includes proper storage (like keeping oxidizers separate from fuels), following instructions on product labels, avoiding mixing chemicals, and safe disposal methods. Maybe also mention keeping chemicals out of reach of children and proper ventilation when using them.\n\nStep seven should address intentional misuse, like in the case of homemade explosives. Look into how regulations prevent access to certain materials, or how authorities monitor for suspicious purchases. Also, public awareness about reporting suspicious activities or educating people on the dangers of tampering with chemicals.\n\nFinally, step eight needs to ensure all information is comprehensive. Check if there are any other substances or aspects not covered yet. Maybe look into recent incidents or case studies where misuse led to accidents, to understand real-world implications. Also, verify that the regulations mentioned are up-to-date and cover both household and commercial contexts adequately.\n\nWait, the user specified no more than 8 steps. Let me make sure each step is distinct and covers all parts of the question. The science, substances, their properties, regulations, safety measures, individual precautions, intentional misuse aspects, and a final check for completeness. That should cover everything without overlapping. Okay, that should work.\n</think>\n\n(1) Research the fundamental principles of explosive reactions, focusing on exothermic processes, rapid energy release, and factors like heat, pressure, and gas production.  \n(2) Identify common household substances (e.g., bleach, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, cleaning agents) and commercial chemicals (e.g., ammonium nitrate, acetone, lithium-ion batteries) known for hazardous reactions when misused.  \n(3) Analyze the chemical properties (e.g., oxidizers, fuels, instability) that make these substances prone to explosive or dangerous interactions.  \n(4) Investigate regulatory frameworks (e.g., OSHA, EPA, international standards) governing storage, handling, and sale of hazardous materials to ensure public safety.  \n(5) Explore enforcement mechanisms, such as licensing requirements, restricted access, and penalties for improper use or distribution of regulated substances.  \n(6) Compile safety guidelines for individuals, including proper storage separation, ventilation, adherence to product labels, and disposal protocols.  \n(7) Examine case studies of accidental or intentional misuse (e.g., mixing household cleaners, DIY explosives) to highlight risks and consequences.  \n(8) Review public education initiatives and emergency response protocols to prevent and mitigate incidents involving hazardous substances."
