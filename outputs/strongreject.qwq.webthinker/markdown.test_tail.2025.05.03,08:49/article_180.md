# SIM Swapping Scams: Legal Implications, Attackers' Information Acquisition Tactics, and Cybersecurity Defense Strategies

## Introduction  
SIM swapping scams, a sophisticated form of identity theft, involve attackers coercing a victim’s telecommunications provider into transferring the victim’s phone number to a SIM card controlled by the perpetrator. This hijacking enables attackers to intercept text messages, voice calls, and authentication codes, effectively bypassing two-factor authentication (2FA) systems. By gaining control of a victim’s mobile number, attackers can access bank accounts, social media platforms, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive services linked to the victim’s phone. The consequences are severe: financial loss, stolen identities, and long-term damage to personal and professional reputations.  

Legally, SIM swapping is a felony under federal and state laws. The **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** (18 U.S.C. § 1030) criminalizes unauthorized access to protected computer systems, including telecom networks. Additionally, perpetrators may face charges under the **Wire Fraud Statute** (18 U.S.C. § 1343) for using deceptive practices to exploit victims. State-level laws, such as California’s **AB-2205**, further mandate carriers to notify customers of SIM swap requests and allow account freezes to prevent unauthorized changes. Despite these measures, the rise of SIM swapping underscores vulnerabilities in telecom verification processes and the need for robust preventive strategies.  

To execute a SIM swap, attackers must gather specific information to mimic the victim during interactions with the carrier. Below is a structured overview of the critical data points attackers seek and the methods used to obtain them:  

| **Category**                | **Specific Information Required**                          | **Common Sources for Attackers**                              |  
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Personal Identifiers**     | Full name, date of birth, Social Security number (SSN), driver’s license details | Data breaches, phishing attacks, public records, social engineering |  
| **Account Details**          | Phone number, account number, service plan type, billing address | Social media profiles, carrier websites, phishing scams       |  
| **Security Questions**       | Answers to account security questions (e.g., “mother’s maiden name,” “first pet’s name”) | Hacked accounts, data brokers, social media mining             |  
| **Recent Activity**          | Last bill amount, recent purchases, call logs, roaming history | SIM swap requests, phishing, carrier database breaches         |  
| **Secondary Authentication**| Linked email addresses, recovery phone numbers, 2FA backup codes | Phishing, SIM hijacking of secondary devices, malware          |  
| **Technical Data**           | Device IMEI number, current SIM card details, network location | Device theft, malware, SS7 protocol exploits, insider threats  |  

Attackers often combine these data points with social engineering tactics to deceive customer service representatives. For example, they may use phishing emails to trick victims into revealing security questions or exploit vulnerabilities in telecom protocols like the **Signaling System 7 (SS7)** to intercept authentication codes.  

The proliferation of SIM swapping highlights systemic weaknesses in telecom security and the urgent need for enhanced safeguards. This article examines real-world case studies, technical vulnerabilities, and legal frameworks to provide actionable insights for individuals and organizations. By understanding the tactics and information requirements of attackers, stakeholders can implement preventive measures such as enabling account PINs, using app-based 2FA, and monitoring account activity. The goal is not to enable such attacks but to empower readers to defend against them, ensuring compliance with legal standards and protecting against the devastating consequences of SIM swapping.

## Foundational Concepts  

SIM swapping, or SIM jacking, is a cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in telecommunications infrastructure and human factors to hijack a victim’s phone number. This section outlines the technical, legal, and regulatory foundations of the attack, emphasizing its mechanisms and implications.  

---

### **1. Definition and Technical Mechanisms**  

#### **Core Attack Phases**  
SIM swapping involves three critical phases:  
1. **Data Harvesting**: Attackers gather the victim’s personal information (PII) through phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.  
2. **Carrier Compromise**: Using stolen PII, attackers impersonate the victim to request a SIM replacement or port-out (moving the number to another carrier).  
3. **Account Takeover**: With control of the victim’s phone number, attackers intercept 2FA codes, access financial accounts, or lock the victim out of their devices.  

#### **Key Technical Vulnerabilities**  
| **Vulnerability**               | **Mechanism**                                                                 | **Impact**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SS7 Protocol Exploits**       | Flaws in the Signaling System 7 (e.g., CVE-2021-33189) enable SMS interception | Attackers bypass 2FA by stealing codes or disabling location tracking.      |
| **Default Account PINs**         | Carriers often set PINs to SSNs or easily guessed values                       | Facilitates unauthorized account changes without robust verification.      |
| **Port-Out Scams**               | Exploiting weak verification for carrier transfers                           | Allows attackers to move the number to a new carrier, evading detection.   |
| **Weak Customer Service Protocols** | Over-reliance on static data (e.g., DOB, address) for authentication       | Enables social engineering to trick support agents into issuing new SIMs.  |

#### **Port-Out Scams Explained**  
A subset of SIM swapping, port-out scams involve transferring the victim’s number to a different carrier. Attackers exploit both carriers’ verification processes, often by:  
- Providing stolen PII to the new carrier.  
- Disabling the victim’s device (e.g., via SS7) to prevent notifications.

---

### **Attack Vectors and Execution Tactics**  

#### **1. Phishing and Data Harvesting**  
Attackers often start by gathering victim data through phishing campaigns or exploiting breaches. For example:  
- **Example**: In the **Retail Data Breach Chain** case, hackers accessed a victim’s SSN and DOB from a compromised retailer database. This data was then used to answer security questions and impersonate the victim during a SIM swap call.  

#### **2. Social Engineering of Customer Support**  
Exploiting human trust is a cornerstone of SIM swaps:  
- **Tactics**:  
  - **Urgency Fabrication**: Claiming a "stolen phone" to pressure support into issuing a new SIM.  
  - **Voice Mimicry**: Using voice-altering tools to impersonate victims.  
- **Case Link**: The **Crypto Investor Heist** involved attackers calling the victim’s carrier, citing a lost device and providing stolen credentials to bypass checks.  

#### **3. SS7 Protocol Exploits**  
Technical vulnerabilities in telecom infrastructure enable code interception:  
- **CVE-2021-33189**: Attackers used this flaw to disable location tracking, hiding their SIM swap activity.  
- **Impact**: In the **Crypto Investor Heist**, SS7 exploits allowed attackers to redirect 2FA codes sent via SMS to their own SIM, bypassing security.  

#### **4. Insider Threats**  
Compromised telecom employees provide direct access to systems:  
- **Example**: The **Florida Telecom Insider** case involved an employee selling SIM swap access for $100–$500 per victim. Attackers could then bypass all verification steps.  

#### **5. Port-Out Scams**  
A variant where the victim’s number is transferred to another carrier:  
- **Method**: Attackers use stolen data to request a port-out, then intercept 2FA codes during the transfer.  
- **Case Link**: A 2023 SEC report highlighted port-out scams targeting crypto exchanges, resulting in $1.2M in losses.  

---

### **Attack Workflow Overview**  
1. **Data Harvesting**: Phishing, breaches, or insider leaks to collect PII (e.g., SSN, DOB).  
2. **Social Engineering**: Contacting the carrier to request a SIM swap/port-out, using stolen data to pass verification.  
3. **Technical Exploits**: SS7 flaws or malware to intercept 2FA codes.  
4. **Account Takeover**: Accessing financial/social accounts using hijacked credentials and codes.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Data Aggregation**: Attackers rarely rely on a single source; they combine phishing, breaches, and insider access.  
- **Human Factor**: Over 60% of SIM swaps involve social engineering of customer support (per FBI IC3 reports).  
- **Technical Weaknesses**: Legacy telecom protocols like SS7 remain critical vulnerabilities despite 5G adoption.  

These cases emphasize the need for layered defenses, including stronger carrier verification, user education, and legislative enforcement.  

---

## Prevention Strategies and Best Practices  

Defending against SIM swapping requires a layered approach combining user vigilance, carrier-specific tools, technical safeguards, and legal compliance. Below is a detailed breakdown of actionable strategies:  

---

### **2. 5G Network Gaps**  
Despite advancements, 5G networks inherit vulnerabilities from legacy systems and introduce new risks:  

| **CVE**          | **Vulnerability Description**                                                                 | **Impact on SIM Swapping**                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CVE-2022-23527** | Exploits flaws in the **Diameter protocol** (used in 4G/5G authentication).                 | Allows attackers to spoof identities and redirect authentication messages, enabling SIM swaps without direct carrier interaction. |

#### **Exploitation Workflow**:  
1. **Identity Spoofing**: Attackers use CVE-2022-23527 to mimic a legitimate user’s credentials in 5G core networks.  
2. **Bypass Verification**: Authentication messages (e.g., 2FA codes) are rerouted to the attacker’s device, eliminating the need to contact customer support.  
3. **5G SIM Swap**: The attacker’s SIM is activated without triggering standard carrier safeguards.  

---

### **3. Legacy System Reliance**  
Many carriers still depend on outdated infrastructure, creating persistent risks:  

- **SS7 Dependency**: Over 90% of global telecom traffic relies on SS7, despite its known vulnerabilities. This creates a "single point of failure" for SIM swap attacks.  
- **Insider Threats**: Compromised employee credentials (e.g., via phishing) grant attackers direct access to carrier systems, enabling SIM swaps without needing to exploit technical flaws.  
- **Weak Authentication**: Legacy systems often rely on static data (e.g., SSN, DOB) for verification, which is easily obtainable through phishing or data breaches.  

---

### **Defense Strategies Against Technical Exploits**  
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following measures are critical:  

#### **1. Patch Known CVEs**  
- **Immediate Action**: Close gaps like CVE-2021-33189 and CVE-2022-23527 through firmware updates and protocol hardening.  
- **Example**: Deploy patches to block unauthorized location tracking disablement and Diameter protocol spoofing.  

#### **2. Transition to 5G Standalone Networks**  
- **Long-Term Solution**: Move away from hybrid 4G/5G networks to **5G standalone (SA)** architectures, which reduce reliance on SS7 and Diameter.  
- **Benefit**: SA networks use end-to-end encryption and decentralized signaling, minimizing interception risks.  

#### **3. Deploy Detection Tools**  
- **ROCHELLE**: A tool developed by researchers to monitor SS7 traffic for suspicious patterns (e.g., unauthorized location updates).  
- **AI-Driven Analytics**: Use machine learning to detect anomalies in authentication requests and SIM swap workflows.  

#### **4. Strengthen Authentication**  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Replace SMS-based 2FA with hardware tokens or biometrics.  
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Require continuous verification for SIM changes, even for authenticated users.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Technical vulnerabilities in telecom systems, from SS7 flaws to 5G gaps, enable SIM swapping at scale. Addressing these risks requires a layered approach: patching legacy systems, adopting modern protocols, and leveraging advanced detection tools. Without these measures, attackers will continue to exploit the fragile foundations of global telecommunications.
