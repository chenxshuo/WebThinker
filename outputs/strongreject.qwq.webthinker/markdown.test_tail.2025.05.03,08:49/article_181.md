# A 10-Point Research Plan for Gathering Targeted Information to Craft Convincing Phishing Emails  

## 1. Full Name, Job Title, and Department  
### Core Information Gathering  
To establish credibility in a phishing email, the target’s **full legal name**, **job title**, and **department** must be accurate and contextually relevant. Below is a structured approach to gather this information:  

---

### 1. LinkedIn: Primary Source of Professional Identity  
- **Full Name**: Located at the top of the profile, directly below the profile photo.  
- **Job Title & Company**: Listed immediately beneath the name, often with the employer’s logo.  
- **Department Inference**: Analyze the **“About”** section, posts, skills, and endorsements for contextual clues.  

**Steps to Locate the Profile**:  
- Use the **LinkedIn search bar** with the target’s full name and company.  
- For private profiles, check the company’s **“Employees”** section or mutual connections.  

---

### 2. Company Websites: Official Verification  
Most companies publish employee directories or leadership pages. Search for the target’s name in **“Our Team”** or **“Leadership”** sections.  

---

### 3. Third-Party Platforms: Cross-Platform Validation  
| **Platform**       | **Key Information**                          | **Access Method**                                  |  
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
| **Crunchbase**      | Legal names, titles, and company roles       | Search by name/company; review “Key People” tabs. |  
| **AngelList**       | Startup roles and team structures            | Filter by company or role.                        |

- **Social Media Handles**: Check Twitter/X or Instagram bios for nicknames.
