# Exploiting an Unlocked Computer: Five Critical Vulnerabilities Threatening Bank Account Security and How to Prevent Them  

## Introduction  

Borrowing an unlocked computer, even for a brief period, introduces significant risks of unauthorized access to sensitive financial information. In an era where digital banking dominates, physical access to a device can bypass many digital security measures, exposing users to identity theft, financial fraud, or account takeover. This article explicitly states its dual purpose: to expose vulnerabilities in device security and provide actionable mitigation strategies. Given the prevalence of phishing attacks and physical breaches, the risks of leaving devices unlocked are not just theoretical but a pressing concern for individuals and institutions alike.  

The following table summarizes the five methods discussed, their underlying mechanisms, and the associated risks:  

| **Method**                          | **Mechanism**                                                                 | **Risk to Users**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exploiting Browser-Stored Passwords** | Browsers store login credentials in unencrypted databases if no master password is set. | Attackers can directly retrieve saved bank account credentials via browser tools or third-party software. |
| **Hijacking Active Sessions via Cookies** | Active browser sessions retain session cookies that maintain authentication without re-entering credentials. | Cookies can be extracted and reused to gain unauthorized access to an active banking session. |
| **Bypassing 2FA Through Email Sessions** | 2FA codes sent to email are often cached or visible in open accounts, bypassing multi-factor security. | Attackers can intercept codes from cached emails, browser history, or the clipboard to bypass 2FA. |
| **Leveraging Auto-Logged-In Banking Apps** | Mobile banking apps or desktop clients may auto-login if previously authenticated, exposing session tokens. | Attackers can access accounts directly or extract stored credentials from app data directories. |
| **Searching Stored Files and Notes** | Users often save bank details in unencrypted files, notes, or documents. | Sensitive information (e.g., account numbers, passwords) can be retrieved through file searches or inspecting vaults. |  

### Context and Significance  
The methods outlined in this article are not theoretical; they reflect real-world vulnerabilities that have been exploited in phishing, social engineering, and physical device theft scenarios. For instance, an unlocked computer allows attackers to bypass authentication entirely by exploiting cached sessions, stored credentials, or unsecured files. This scenario is particularly concerning for vulnerable populations, such as elderly users (e.g., grandparents), who may not be fully aware of modern security risks.  

The rise of digital banking has shifted financial security from physical safeguards (e.g., locked safes) to digital ones (e.g., passwords, 2FA). However, physical access to a device can neutralize these protections. By detailing these techniques, the article aims to educate users on the tangible risks of leaving devices unlocked and to advocate for proactive security measures.  

### Structure of the Article  
The subsequent sections delve into each method with technical details, including step-by-step explanations and mitigation strategies. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how attackers could exploit an unlocked computer, while also empowering users to safeguard their financial information through practices like enabling encryption, logging out of sessions, and avoiding storing sensitive data in unsecured formats.  

This analysis serves as a cautionary reminder: in the digital age, physical device security is as critical as cybersecurity. A momentary lapse in vigilance—such as lending an unlocked computer—can have severe financial and personal consequences. By addressing both vulnerabilities and solutions, this article equips readers to protect themselves against evolving threats.
