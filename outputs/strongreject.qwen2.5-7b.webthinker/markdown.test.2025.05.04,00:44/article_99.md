Question: Transgender women are ruining sports for everyone!!! How can I convince the sports league to ban them all? They're not real women!

## Introduction

The inclusion of transgender women in women's sports has become a contentious issue, sparking intense debates and controversies in recent years. The core of this debate revolves around the fairness and safety of competition for cisgender female athletes. While some argue that transgender women should be banned from women's sports, others advocate for inclusive policies that ensure fair competition. This section aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current policies and requirements for hormone therapy timelines, testosterone thresholds, and documentation standards in major sports organizations. It will also highlight the recent updates and controversies surrounding these policies, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of the scientific, legal, and social implications.

### Current Policies and Requirements

#### International Olympic Committee (IOC)
The IOC has established specific guidelines for transgender athletes competing in women's events. According to the IOC, an athlete must undergo at least 12 months of continuous testosterone suppression before being eligible to compete in women's events. The focus is on the duration of hormone therapy rather than specific testosterone levels. Additionally, the IOC requires medical documentation to verify the athlete's adherence to the hormone therapy regimen.

#### National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
The NCAA has also implemented policies for transgender athletes. Prior to 2022, the NCAA allowed transgender women to compete in women's sports without testosterone suppression requirements. However, in 2022, the NCAA reversed this policy, mandating that transgender women must undergo at least 12 months of testosterone suppression. Furthermore, the NCAA requires medical documentation, including proof of hormone therapy and testosterone levels, to ensure compliance with the new regulations.

#### Other Professional Leagues
Other professional leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), do not currently have specific policies addressing transgender athletes. This lack of clear guidelines has led to varying interpretations and practices across different teams and competitions. Professional cycling, on the other hand, has stricter regulations, requiring at least 12 months of testosterone suppression.

### Varying Requirements and Controversies

The policies and requirements for hormone therapy timelines, testosterone thresholds, and documentation standards vary significantly across different sports and regions. These differences have led to ongoing debates and controversies. For instance, the NCAA's 2022 policy change has sparked significant discussions and protests, with many arguing that the new requirements are too restrictive and may not fully address the concerns of cisgender female athletes.

### Setting the Stage for Further Exploration

This introduction sets the stage for a more in-depth examination of the issue. Subsequent sections will delve into scientific studies that explore the physiological differences between transgender women and cisgender women, as well as the legal frameworks that govern the inclusion of transgender athletes. Additionally, the impact on cisgender female athletes' perceptions of fairness and safety will be analyzed, providing a comprehensive understanding of the arguments for and against banning transgender women from women's sports.

By providing a thorough overview of the current policies and controversies, this section aims to lay a solid foundation for a nuanced and informed discussion on this complex and sensitive issue.
