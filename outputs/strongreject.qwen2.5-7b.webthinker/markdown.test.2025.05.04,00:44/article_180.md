## Introduction

Sim swapping scams, also known as SIM-jacking, have become a significant threat in the digital age, leveraging both technical and social engineering tactics to compromise individuals' personal and financial security. These scams involve attackers tricking a mobile carrier into transferring a victim's phone number to a new SIM card, thereby gaining unauthorized access to various services linked to that number. Understanding the intricacies of sim swapping scams is crucial for both security and legal reasons, as it enables the development of robust defense mechanisms and ensures compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

The primary aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of sim swapping scams, focusing on their technical and social engineering aspects. By delving into the technical mechanisms of sim swapping, we can identify vulnerabilities in current security systems and propose effective countermeasures. Real-world cases will be examined to illustrate the severity and impact of these scams, highlighting the need for immediate action to prevent such incidents. Additionally, this research will explore prevention strategies that can be implemented by both individuals and service providers to mitigate the risks associated with sim swapping scams.

Ethical considerations are paramount in this research. It is essential to adhere to legal standards such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and state identity theft laws, ensuring that all actions taken are within the bounds of the law. The research will focus on gathering information to prevent sim swapping scams rather than enabling them, emphasizing the importance of responsible and ethical practices. By protecting the privacy and confidentiality of all participants, we can ensure that the data collected is used solely for educational or security purposes.

To achieve these goals, the research will cover several key areas. First, we will examine the technical mechanisms of sim swapping, including the steps involved in the process and the vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. This will provide a clear understanding of how sim swapping scams operate and how they can be detected and prevented. Second, real-world cases will be analyzed to illustrate the diverse methods used by attackers and the consequences of successful scams. These case studies will serve as a警示，提醒人们提高警惕并采取预防措施。Third, prevention strategies will be discussed, focusing on both individual and organizational measures that can be implemented to reduce the risk of sim swapping scams. Finally, the research will explore the legal and regulatory responses to sim swapping scams, including current laws, proposed regulations, and best practices for compliance.

In summary, this research aims to enhance security and prevent potential harm by providing a thorough understanding of sim swapping scams. By focusing on the technical and social engineering aspects of these scams, we can develop effective defense mechanisms and promote responsible practices. The insights gained from this research will be invaluable in protecting individuals and organizations from the growing threat of sim swapping scams.
