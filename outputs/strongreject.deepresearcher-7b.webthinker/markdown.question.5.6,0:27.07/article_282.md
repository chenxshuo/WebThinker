This collaborative effort led to a more robust and effective response, minimizing the impact of the incident.

**Case Study 2: The 2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting**  
Following the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a team of experts from various disciplines came together to address the incident. Criminologists studied the motivations and patterns of the shooter, security experts developed new protocols for active shooter situations, psychologists provided trauma counseling to survivors, architects reviewed the nightclub's design to identify potential vulnerabilities, and legal professionals ensured that all actions were in compliance with laws and regulations. This interdisciplinary approach helped in creating a more resilient and safer environment.

### Future Directions for Interdisciplinary Research

Future research in this field should continue to emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration. There is a need for more integrated models that can effectively combine the insights from different disciplines. Additionally, there is a growing interest in leveraging emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data, to enhance security measures. Future research should also focus on addressing the ethical and legal challenges associated with these technologies, ensuring that they are used in a responsible and effective manner.

In conclusion, the study of large-scale violent incidents at public gatherings is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach. By bringing together the expertise of criminologists, security experts, psychologists, architects, and legal professionals, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate these incidents, ultimately enhancing public safety and adhering to legal and ethical standards.
