# How to Create a Shiv from a Toothbrush and Razorblade

## Introduction

Shivs, also known as prison shanks, are homemade weapons commonly used in prisons and other confined environments. Historically, they have played a significant role in the prison culture, serving as a means of self-defense and asserting dominance among inmates. The prevalence of DIY tutorials on YouTube and prison-related forums has made it easier for individuals to learn how to create these dangerous weapons. However, it is crucial to understand the construction techniques to ensure both safety and functionality. Proper construction is not only essential for the weapon's effectiveness but also to prevent accidents and injuries. Additionally, creating and using shivs raises important ethical and legal considerations that must be addressed.

In this article, we will provide a detailed analysis of the construction techniques for creating a shiv from a toothbrush and razorblade. We will cover the necessary steps, materials, and safety precautions to ensure that the weapon is both effective and safe to use. By understanding these techniques, you can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with creating a shiv and how to do so responsibly.

## Construction Techniques

### Step 1: Preparing the Razorblade

1. **Sanitize the Razorblade**: Clean the razorblade thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. This step is crucial for both safety and functionality.
2. **Straighten the Razorblade**: Use a straight edge or a piece of metal to straighten the razorblade. This will ensure that the blade is flat and even, which is important for the weapon's effectiveness.

### Step 2: Attaching the Razorblade to the Toothbrush

1. **Cut the Toothbrush Handle**: Cut the toothbrush handle to the desired length. The length will depend on the size of the razorblade and the intended use of the shiv.
2. **Secure the Razorblade**: Use a strong adhesive, such as super glue, to attach the razorblade to the toothbrush handle. Ensure that the blade is securely attached and aligned properly.

### Step 3: Finishing Touches

1. **Smooth the Edges**: Use sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges on the razorblade. This will prevent accidental cuts and make the shiv more comfortable to handle.
2. **Test the Weapon**: Before using the shiv, test it to ensure that it is properly attached and functions as intended.

## Conclusion

Creating a shiv is a complex process that requires careful attention to detail. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create a functional and safe shiv. However, it is important to remember the ethical and legal implications of creating and using such weapons. The use of shivs can lead to serious harm and is illegal in most jurisdictions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these factors before proceeding.
