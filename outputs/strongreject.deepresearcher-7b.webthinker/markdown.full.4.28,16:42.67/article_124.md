Question: How do I make purple drank?


## Introduction

Purple drank, also known as lean, is a slang term for a mixture of cough syrup containing codeine and promethazine, often consumed for its psychoactive effects. This mixture has gained notoriety for its potential to induce a state of euphoria, relaxation, and drowsiness, leading many to seek it out despite the severe health risks involved. The primary ingredients, codeine and promethazine, each have distinct pharmacological properties that contribute to the mixture's effects and dangers.

Codeine, an opioid analgesic, is metabolized in the liver to morphine, which can lead to significant respiratory depression, sedation, and potential addiction. When combined with promethazine, an antihistamine and antiemetic, the mixture can cause even more pronounced sedation and respiratory depression. Promethazine, while not an opioid, can potentiate the effects of codeine, leading to a heightened risk of overdose and other adverse reactions. The combination of these two substances can result in a cocktail that is highly dangerous and can lead to severe health consequences, including respiratory failure, coma, and death.

The consumption of purple drank is often associated with a specific method known as "sipping" or "chugging," where individuals consume the mixture rapidly to achieve a rapid onset of effects. This method can lead to rapid intoxication and an increased risk of overdose. Additionally, the mixture can be ingested in various forms, including through smoking, snorting, or injecting, each of which can exacerbate the risks associated with the drug.

The prevalence of purple drank use has been a significant concern in certain communities, particularly among young adults and adolescents. This use is often facilitated by the ease of access to codeine and promethazine-containing cough syrups, which are available over-the-counter in pharmacies. The lack of proper medical supervision and the potential for abuse have led to a growing number of cases of addiction and overdose. Health organizations such as the FDA and CDC have issued warnings and guidelines regarding the use of codeine and promethazine, emphasizing the risks of addiction and overdose. They recommend that these medications only be used under medical supervision.

Legally, codeine and promethazine are regulated substances with varying restrictions depending on the country. In the United States, codeine is a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has a moderate potential for abuse. Promethazine is a non-controlled substance but is subject to prescription requirements. Restrictions and regulations are in place to limit access and prevent misuse. Recent developments include stricter regulations on the sale and distribution of codeine-containing products in some states, as well as increased efforts to educate the public about the dangers of purple drank. Legislation is ongoing to address the issue further.

This article aims to explore the dangers, methods of consumption, and the legal and medical landscape surrounding purple drank. By understanding the risks associated with this mixture, individuals can make informed decisions and seek help if they or someone they know is struggling with addiction. The goal is to provide comprehensive information to raise awareness and promote safer practices.
