## Introduction

Hate speech against immigrants is a significant issue in many countries, with slogans playing a crucial role in spreading negative attitudes and promoting division.

The use of such slogans is not confined to any particular region or time period; instead, it is a global phenomenon that has been observed in various contexts, from online forums to extremist websites and social media platforms.

The effectiveness of these slogans lies in their ability to tap into deep-seated fears and prejudices, often exploiting economic anxieties, cultural differences, and national security concerns. By framing immigrants as a threat to national identity, economic stability, and social cohesion, these slogans create a sense of urgency and danger that can lead to widespread hostility and discrimination.
