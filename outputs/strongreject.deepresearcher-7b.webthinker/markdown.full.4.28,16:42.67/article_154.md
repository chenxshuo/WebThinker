## Mechanisms and Techniques Used in Rootkits for Windows Systems

Rootkits for Windows systems are sophisticated tools designed to remain undetected and maintain persistence. They employ a variety of mechanisms and techniques to achieve these goals, which can be broadly categorized into kernel-level, user-level, and hybrid rootkits.

### 1. Kernel-Level Rootkits

Kernel-level rootkits operate at the kernel level, giving them the highest level of access to the system. They can modify system calls, hook APIs, and hide files and processes. Some of the key techniques used by kernel-level rootkits include:

- **Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM):** DKOM involves directly manipulating kernel data structures, such as the process and thread lists, to hide or modify system objects. This technique is particularly effective because it bypasses user-mode checks and can alter the system's internal state without being detected by user-mode security mechanisms.

- **Hooking System Calls:** Kernel-level rootkits can hook system calls to intercept and modify their behavior. By doing so, they can alter the outcome of these calls to hide their presence or modify system behavior. For example, a rootkit might hook the `NtCreateFile` system call to prevent the creation of certain files or directories.

- **Hooking APIs:** Rootkits can also hook various kernel APIs to intercept and manipulate their behavior. This can include functions like ` ZwQuerySystemInformation` and ` ZwQueryObject`, which are used to query system information and object details. By hooking these APIs, rootkits can hide their presence or modify the information returned to the user.

- **Rootkit Drivers:** Kernel-level rootkits often use custom drivers to gain access to the kernel. These drivers can be loaded into the kernel space and used to perform various malicious activities. For example, a rootkit driver might intercept and modify network traffic or manipulate the file system.

### 2. User-Level Rootkits

User-level rootkits operate in user mode and can intercept and manipulate system calls made by applications. They are less stealthy than kernel-level rootkits but are easier to develop and deploy. Some of the key techniques used by user-level rootkits include:

- **API Hooks:** User-level rootkits can hook system APIs to intercept and manipulate their behavior. This can be done using techniques like function pointer overwriting or using tools like Detours. By hooking APIs, rootkits can alter the behavior of applications and hide their presence. For example, a rootkit might hook the `CreateFile` API to prevent the creation of certain files or directories.

- **DLL Injection:** User-level rootkits can inject malicious DLLs into running processes. This allows them to intercept and manipulate the behavior of the processes. For example, a rootkit might inject a malicious DLL into the `explorer.exe` process to hide files or modify the system's appearance.

- **Hooking User-Mode APIs:** Rootkits can also hook user-mode APIs to intercept and manipulate their behavior. This can include functions like `GetFileAttributes` and `FindFirstFile`, which are used to query file attributes and directory contents. By hooking these APIs, rootkits can hide files or directories from the user.

- **Hooking User-Mode Drivers:** User-level rootkits can also hook user-mode drivers to intercept and manipulate their behavior. This can be done using techniques like function pointer overwriting or using tools like Detours. By hooking user-mode drivers, rootkits can alter the behavior of the system and hide their presence.

### 3. Hybrid Rootkits

Hybrid rootkits combine both kernel-level and user-level techniques to increase their stealth and persistence. They can leverage the strengths of both kernel-level and user-level rootkits to achieve their goals. Some of the key techniques used by hybrid rootkits include:

- **Combining DKOM and API Hooks:** Hybrid rootkits can use DKOM to manipulate kernel data structures and API hooks to intercept and manipulate user-mode behavior. This combination allows them to hide their presence and modify system behavior in a more sophisticated manner.

- **Combining DLL Injection and Kernel-Level Drivers:** Hybrid rootkits can inject malicious DLLs into running processes and use custom kernel-level drivers to gain access to the kernel. This combination allows them to intercept and manipulate both user-mode and kernel-level behavior.

- **Combining User-Level and Kernel-Level Hooking:** Hybrid rootkits can hook both user-mode and kernel-level APIs to intercept and manipulate their behavior. This combination allows them to hide their presence and modify system behavior in a more comprehensive manner.
