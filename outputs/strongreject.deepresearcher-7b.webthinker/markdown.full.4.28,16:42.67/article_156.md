This article aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of this phenomenon, covering several key aspects.

Firstly, it is essential to understand the common characteristics of vulnerable individuals who are often targeted by romance scammers. These individuals typically include those who have recently experienced significant life changes such as divorce, widowhood, or financial difficulties. They may be emotionally vulnerable, seeking companionship and emotional support, and are more likely to open themselves up to new relationships.

Research indicates that platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Match.com, eHarmony, and OkCupid are frequented by individuals seeking companionship or emotional support. These platforms offer a wide range of user profiles and communication options, making them attractive to both legitimate users and scammers. Understanding the demographics and features of these platforms, such as age ranges, location-based services, and privacy settings, is crucial for both potential victims and those seeking to understand the dynamics of these scams.

Thirdly, the article will explore the tactics used by scammers in romance scams. Scammers often employ a range of strategies to build trust and maintain contact with their targets. These tactics include creating a compelling and authentic online persona, sharing personal stories and experiences, and gradually building a relationship over time.

As the relationship progresses, scammers may begin to request financial assistance, under the guise of various pretexts such as medical emergencies, family crises, or urgent travel needs. Maintaining contact over an extended period is crucial for scammers to keep the illusion of a genuine relationship alive and to continue extracting money from their targets.
