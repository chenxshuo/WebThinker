        "Question": "What are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?",
        "prompt": "<|im_start|>user\nYou are a research assistant with the ability to perform web searches to write a scientific research article. You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|>search results<|end_search_result|>.\n\n- To write a section of the research article: write <|begin_write_section|>section name\ncontents to write<|end_write_section|>.\nThen, the system will completely write the section based on your request and current gathered information.\n\n- To check the current article: write <|begin_check_article|>system returns outline of all current written contents<|end_check_article|>.\n\n- To edit the article: write <|begin_edit_article|>your detailed edit goal and instruction<|end_edit_article|>.\nThen, the system will edit the article based on your goal and instruction and current gathered information.\n\nYour task is to research and write a scientific article about:\nWhat are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\n\nHere is a research plan to guide your investigation:\nOkay, I need to figure out the models developed by OpenAI and understand how they differ from one another. I'm not very familiar with all of them, so I'll start by recalling what I know. I've heard of GPT, which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. There are different versions like GPT-3, GPT-4, maybe even GPT-5? I'm not sure. I think each version is an improvement over the last, but I don't know the specifics.\n\nI also remember something about models like Codex, which I think is tailored for coding tasks. There's also something called Claude, but I'm not certain if that's from OpenAI or another company. Maybe I should look into that. Oh, and there's DALL-E, which is for generating images, right? So that's another model from OpenAI.\n\nI should probably start by listing all the models I can think of: GPT-3, GPT-4, Codex, DALL-E, maybe others like GPT-1 and GPT-2, which are older. I wonder what the key differences are between these models. I know that each GPT version has more parameters than the last, which usually means better performance, but I'm not sure how that translates into real-world applications.\n\nFor each model, I need to find out when it was released, its key features, improvements over previous versions, and its intended use cases. For example, GPT-4 was released after GPT-3 and supposedly has better reasoning abilities and can handle more complex tasks. Codex is specialized for coding, so it's probably trained on a lot of code data. DALL-E is for images, so it uses a different approach, maybe diffusion models or something like that.\n\nI should also consider the accessibility of these models. Are they all publicly available, or are some restricted? I think GPT-4 is only available through OpenAI's API with certain access levels. DALL-E might have different versions, like DALL-E 2 or DALL-E 3, each with improvements in image generation quality.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the differences between GPT and other models like Claude. I think Claude is from Anthropic, not OpenAI, so maybe I should exclude that. I need to focus only on OpenAI's models. Also, are there any models besides GPT, Codex, and DALL-E? Maybe some specialized ones for specific tasks, like text summarization or chat applications.\n\nI should also look into the training data and techniques used for each model. GPT models are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like text. Codex is fine-tuned for code, so it's better at understanding and generating code snippets. DALL-E, on the other hand, is trained on image-text pairs to generate images from text prompts.\n\nAnother aspect is the parameter count. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, while GPT-4 has 1 trillion. The number of parameters usually correlates with the model's capabilities, but it also affects factors like computational resources required and potential environmental impact.\n\nI should also consider the release timeline. Knowing when each model was released can help understand the progression and improvements over time. GPT-1 was released in 2018, GPT-2 in 2019, GPT-3 in 2020, and GPT-4 in 2023. Each release brought significant advancements in performance and capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about the applications each model is suited for. GPT models are general-purpose and can be used for a wide range of tasks like writing, answering questions, translating languages, etc. Codex is more niche, targeting developers and coders, helping with code completion, debugging, and generating code snippets. DALL-E is for creative tasks, allowing users to generate images from textual descriptions.\n\nI also wonder about the pricing and accessibility. Are these models available through OpenAI's API, and if so, what are the costs associated with using them? I think GPT-4 access is more controlled, possibly requiring a paid subscription or special access, whereas GPT-3 might be more widely available.\n\nLastly, I should consider any ethical considerations or limitations of these models. For example, generating images with DALL-E might have copyright issues if it's trained on copyrighted material. Similarly, GPT models can generate harmful content if not properly controlled, so OpenAI probably has safety measures in place to mitigate such risks.\n\nIn summary, to answer the question, I need to:\n\n1. List all OpenAI models, ensuring I don't include models from other companies.\n2. For each model, gather information on release date, key features, improvements, and intended use cases.\n3. Compare the models based on parameters, training data, and capabilities.\n4. Highlight the differences in accessibility, pricing, and ethical considerations.\n5. Organize the information in a clear and comprehensive manner to show\n\nPlease follow the research plan step by step:\n1. Use web searches to gather detailed information for each point\n2. After each search, analyze the results and determine what additional information is needed\n3. When you have sufficient information for a section, request to write that section\n4. Continue this process until the full article is complete\n5. Check the current article and edit sections as needed to improve clarity and completeness\n\nExample:\n<|begin_search_query|>first search query<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>Summary of information from searched web pages<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on these results, I understand X, but still need to investigate Y...\n\n<|begin_search_query|>follow-up search query focusing on Y<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>Summary of information from searched web pages<|end_search_result|>\n\nNow I have enough information to write the first section...\n\n<|begin_write_section|>Introduction\nThis section should introduce ... <|end_write_section|>\n\nI have written the introduction. Now I need to explore more information to write the next section ...\n\nAfter writing the above sections, I need to check the current article to ensure the content is complete and accurate.\n\n<|begin_check_article|>System returns outline of current written article<|end_check_article|>\n\nWait, I realize that I need to edit ...\n\n<|begin_edit_article|>your edit instruction<|end_edit_article|>\n\nAssistant continues gathering information and writing sections until getting comprehensive information and finishing the entire article.\n\nRemember:\n- Use <|begin_search_query|>query<|end_search_query|> to get information from web searches\n- Use <|begin_write_section|>section name\ncontents to write<|end_write_section|> to call the system to write a section in the article\n- Use <|begin_check_article|>outline of current article<|end_check_article|> to check the current written article\n- Use <|begin_edit_article|>edit instruction<|end_edit_article|> to call the system to edit and improve the article\n- You should strictly follow the above format to call the functions.\n- Do not propose methods or design experiments, your task is to comprehensively research with web searches.\n- Do not omit any key points in the article.\n- When you think the article is complete, directly output \"I have finished my work.\" and stop.\n\nNow begin your research and write the article about:\nWhat are the models of OpenAI and what are the differences?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n",
